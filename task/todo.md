# Plan / Todo

The current plan for in-flight work. The operating manuals ([skills/](../skills/)) require this file
to be written **before** any non-trivial change and kept current as work proceeds.

How to use it (see the manuals' §1):

- Write a 3–7 bullet plan here before writing code.
- Flip `[ ]` → `[x]` as items complete; add a one-sentence "what changed and why" per step.
- Add indented sub-bullets when a step reveals unexpected complexity.
- Leave an `Outcome:` / `Done:` note when the work lands.

## ACTIVE UNIT (2026-07-17c): G2 incremental-scan name-mapping pin — branch `fix/g2-incremental-name-mapping-pin`

User-signed 2026-07-17: **FF AC (Fable Actor / independent Fable Critic)** — the user's
chosen mode for G2+G3. Test-only unit closing the #154 Critic's residue (incremental
wiring correct but unpinned). Spec:
[g2-incremental-name-mapping-pin-brief.md](g2-incremental-name-mapping-pin-brief.md)
(C-1…C-5; escape hatch only for a proven-broken wiring).

- [ ] **Build** (Fable Actor): C-1 plan-level pin · C-2 e2e contrast via incremental
      stream · C-3 absent-property fallback pin · C-4 live mutation proof (incremental
      site RED, snapshot pins GREEN) · C-5 reuse #154 fixtures/helpers.
- [ ] **Critic** (independent Fable, fresh context) — convergence is the Critic's call.
- [ ] **Close-out** — tracker flip, push, PR body delivered. G3 (HMS timestamptz, FF)
      follows after merge.

## DONE 2026-07-17 (merged #155): G1 Glue type-string byte-parity — was branch `fix/g1-glue-type-string-byte-parity`

User-signed 2026-07-17 (the "G1→G2→G3" follow-up sequence after #152/#153/#154 merged;
G2 = BUG-002 incremental-scan pin, G3 = HMS timestamptz design unit — queued next). OO AC.
Spec: [g1-glue-type-string-byte-parity-brief.md](g1-glue-type-string-byte-parity-brief.md)
(C-1…C-7, oracle pre-decoded from `iceberg-aws-1.10.0.jar` bytecode). Closes the #153
Fable-max Critic residues: struct-join separator (fork `", "` vs Java `","`), naive-nano
string (`"timestamp_ns"` vs Java's uniform `"timestamp_nano"`), plus the newly-surfaced
Unknown question (Java renders `"unknown"`, never throws; fork rejects).

- [x] **Build** — DONE 2026-07-17 (0aa61074, Opus Actor): C-1 separator `", "`→`","` (all
      struct pins updated) · C-2 both nano variants → `"timestamp_nano"` (freeze lifted) ·
      C-3 Unknown flipped reject→`"unknown"` (branch (a): UNKNOWN absent from the
      `$SwitchMap` → Java's lowercase default, never throws; no fork dependency on the
      reject) · C-4 field lambda decoded (`%s:%s`, fork already matched; citation added) ·
      C-5 citations bytecode-verified; #153 byte-false comment corrected · C-6 byte-exact
      pins incl. two-depth struct-in-struct; 3 mutations proven · C-7 R91 cell corrected
      (glue renders "unknown"; hms fact left to G3). 27 crate tests.
- [x] **Critic** — CONVERGED 2026-07-17 (independent Opus, fresh context, zero findings at
      the S2 floor). Third independent bytecode decode: zero string divergence, all comment
      offsets byte-accurate. Re-ran M1–M3 + extra M4 (field-lambda format corrupt → 4 pins
      RED — coverage confirmed). Duty-3 verdict: Java's `toColumns` reaches `toTypeString`
      with NO pre-converter validation, so end-to-end behavior matches (an unknown column
      publishes "unknown" on both sides; V2-vs-V3 gate identical both sides). Residue
      (LOW): live-Glue acceptance of "unknown"/"timestamp_nano" strings unverifiable
      offline (parity holds either way — both engines emit byte-identical strings); Java's
      unescaped `name:type` ambiguity for colon-bearing field names is shared, not a fork
      defect.
- [x] **Close-out** — tracker flipped, pushed, PR body delivered. NEXT: G2 (BUG-002
      incremental-scan pin) after this merges, then G3 (HMS timestamptz design unit).

## ACTIVE UNIT (2026-07-17): BUG-002 name-mapping scan wiring — branch `fix/bug-002-name-mapping-scan-wiring`

User-signed 2026-07-17: OO AC (Opus Actor / independent Opus Critic). Spec:
[bug-002-name-mapping-scan-brief.md](bug-002-name-mapping-scan-brief.md) (C-1…C-7); this
section is the tracker. The bug (external audit 2026-07-10, deferred backlog): the scan
hardcodes `name_mapping: None` (`scan/context.rs` TODO) while the downstream
(`FileScanTask.name_mapping` → ArrowReader `apply_name_mapping_to_arrow_schema`) is fully
built — ID-less-Parquet tables with `schema.name-mapping.default` read via position
fallback (wrong-data class) instead of the mapping (Java-divergent).

- [x] **Build** — DONE 2026-07-17 (8680f149 fix+pins+R143 cell, 3aaca2fa interop suite,
      4d559190 empty/whitespace pins; Opus Actor). All 7 clauses landed, PLUS the e2e pin
      exposed TWO further wrong-column bugs the brief's escape hatch authorized fixing, each
      uniquely mutation-pinned: (a) `arrow/reader.rs` used the positional projection mask
      even when a mapping applied; (b) `record_batch_transformer.rs::compare_schemas`
      compared by position → reordered name-mapped files relabeled in place. C-4 decided
      delete-task sites stay `None` (javap: Java `GenericReader`/`DeleteFilter`/
      `BaseDeleteLoader` have zero name-mapping references — engine data reads only).
      Deviation (flagged for merge): `dev/java-interop/pom.xml` +2 test-oracle deps
      (parquet-avro 1.16.0, hadoop-client-api 3.3.6) to write ID-less parquet.
- [x] **Critic** — CONVERGED 2026-07-17 (independent Opus, fresh context, zero findings at
      the S2 floor). Re-decoded the Java jars itself (C-3/C-4 confirmed; novel non-array
      probes matched Java beyond the enumerated partition), re-ran all 3 mutations (each fix
      distinctly+uniquely pinned), blast-radius analysis: both downstream fixes are
      no-op for embedded-id and no-mapping files. Interop: 50/50 discovery, D1 content-equal,
      sabotage RED via the id-less differential (embedded ids would have made it vacuous-
      green — RED proves the mapping is load-bearing). Residue (LOW): incremental-scan
      wiring correct but untested (F-1); driver floor comment staleness (F-2, fixed in
      close-out).
- [x] **Close-out** — tracker flipped, floor comment refreshed, pushed, PR body delivered.

## ACTIVE UNIT (2026-07-16): R158 Java interop battery (🟡→✅) — branch `parity/r158-staged-txn-interop`

User-signed 2026-07-16: OO AC (Opus Actor / Opus Critic, both at MAX effort) via the Workflow
ladder. Spec: [r158-staged-txn-interop-brief.md](r158-staged-txn-interop-brief.md) (C-1…C-9 +
the E-INV replace-invariant enumeration); this section is the tracker.

- [x] **Build** — DONE 2026-07-16 (9b421afa, Opus-max Actor): suite `run-interop-staged-txn.sh`
      (7 steps: Java d1 gen → Rust d2 gen → C-5 cross-check → Java verify → Rust verify →
      3 sabotages) + `InteropOracle.java` scenario (REAL `Transactions.create/replaceTableTransaction`
      over a committable `LocalTableOperations`, mirroring `BaseMetastoreCatalog` — no hand-rolled
      metadata) + `tests/interop_staged_txn.rs`; all C-1…C-9, E-INV(1–7) pinned per-cycle BOTH
      directions; V1-stays-V1 + property-directed upgrade both directions; SB1–SB3 RED +
      hard-fail-never-skip (pattern-absent ⇒ exit 3 ⇒ restore + exit 1); floor 48→49; zero
      production-code change (no parity bug exposed — the D1/D4 fixes held against real Java).
- [x] **Critic ladder** — CONVERGED cycle 1, ZERO findings at the S2 floor (Opus-max, fresh
      context). Critic re-ran the full gate + suite + selftest + 49-discovery itself, and
      mutation-tested SIX verifier assertions across BOTH directions (spliced UUID → Rust RED;
      fmtv leak + last_column_id reduction → Java RED; committed SB1–SB3 observed RED) — proving
      the cross-engine wiring non-tautological (mutating d1 flips only Rust, d2 only Java).
      Java fidelity verified against /tmp/iceberg-java-ref source (buildReplacement,
      persistedProperties, assignFreshIds seeding). Full taxonomy attestation in the run record.
- [x] **Flip + close** — R158 ✅ (residues (1)–(3) retained verbatim; dated 2026-07-16),
      ENGINE_CONTRACT §8a item 5 → PROVEN. Pushed for PR.

## ACTIVE UNIT (2026-07-15): fork-atomicity remediation (R158 staged create/replace) — branch `feat/replace-table-transaction`

SEPMO Actor–Critic unit hardening the just-landed R158 staged transaction (tip 9280320b). Two
findings, both correctness/atomicity, tests in the same commit as the fix; mutation-proved RED on
revert. No `--all-features` (per unit charter); no push.

- [x] **C1 (N1) — create-publish is not atomic.** `MemoryCatalog::register_table` (the
  `publish_create_table` default) inserted the pointer THEN read the metadata; a reload failure
  (staged metadata written through a FileIO the catalog cannot read) left `table_exists=true` +
  `load_table` erroring — a half-created table breaking `IF NOT EXISTS` retry. Fix: read metadata
  BEFORE inserting, under the one catalog lock. Guarantee documented on `publish_create_table` (for
  other Catalog impls) + ENGINE_CONTRACT §8a. Pin: `create_publish_reload_failure_leaves_no_catalog_entry`.
- [x] **C2 (N2) — CREATE OR REPLACE location drift.** `begin_replace` baked
  `"{existing}__staged_replace"` into the new metadata's `location()` and never reset it, so every
  replace relocated the table and compounded the suffix. Fix: keep the stable existing/caller
  location (staging = deferring the pointer swap, not a separate dir). Pin:
  `replace_cycle_keeps_location_stable_and_reads_latest` (triple cycle; location == original each
  publish; reads expose the latest replace's data).

CLOSED 2026-07-15 after a 4-cycle independent Opus Critic ladder (OO AC) over the full branch:

- [x] **CF-1 (D1, MEDIUM) — replace built fresh metadata, inverting Java `buildReplacement`.**
  `begin_replace` used `from_table_creation` (fresh UUID, empty snapshots/metadata-log). Fix
  4b944152: seed `new_from_metadata` — UUID + snapshot history + metadata log retained, ONLY the
  main ref removed, format version never downgraded. Pin:
  `replace_retains_uuid_history_and_metadata_log` (mutation-proven vs fresh-UUID seed AND dropped
  `remove_ref(MAIN)`).
- [x] **CF-4 (D4, MEDIUM) — replace silently upgraded V1→V2** via `max(previous,
  creation.format_version)` with the builder's V2 default. Fix 8c7d2c02: version derived ONLY from
  the `format-version` property (popped before `set_properties`, mirroring Java
  `persistedProperties`); absent ⇒ keep existing; downgrade/unparsable ⇒ DataInvalid;
  `creation.format_version` ignored on replace. Pins:
  `replace_default_creation_preserves_v1_format_version` (mutation-proven),
  `replace_upgrades_format_version_by_property`, `replace_downgrade_attempt_errors_and_keeps_original`.
- [x] **CF-5 (D5, LOW) — docs over-claimed `assignFreshIds` parity**: corrected to caller-ids-as-is
  + named residue (base-aware fresh-id helper = follow-up); new pin
  `replace_with_different_schema_keeps_caller_ids`.
- [x] **F-1 (MEDIUM, found by cycle-3 Critic) — the "unparsable format-version ⇒ DataInvalid"
  claim had ZERO tests** (silent-fallback mutation survived the suite). Fix 2e08a6e4 (test-only):
  `replace_invalid_format_version_property_errors_and_keeps_original` over 8 invalid values incl.
  `"2 "` (anti-trim), each pinning DataInvalid + original unchanged; mutation-proven RED.
- CF-2/CF-3 (LOW) accepted as NAMED residue in the R158 cell: replace-publish lacks
  read-before-swap validation (create has it); staged replace restarts metadata versioning at
  v0/v1. Cycle-4 Critic **CONVERGED** (zero findings; gate 2769 lib green + fmt/clippy/anchors/
  typos). Pushed for PR.

## ACTIVE UNIT (2026-07-13): SEPMO canon v2.2 upgrade + manifest re-instantiation

User-directed 2026-07-13 ("We have updated SEPMO rules we need to implement"): bring the repo's
SEPMO installation (pre-ledger lineage, installed 2026-06-15/25) up to the new master canon
**v2.2** the user supplied (spine + binding-manifest template). One branch
`infra/sepmo-canon-v2.2`, one PR; STANDARD path (governance surface; >5 files and >150 lines —
LIGHT criteria 1/3 fail; uncertain routes STANDARD anyway). Docs-only: no crate code, no matrix
row.

- [x] **1. Canon lands verbatim** — `skills/sepmo/SKILL.md` replaced with the v2.2 spine
      (frontmatter `version: "2.2"`); NEW `skills/sepmo/binding-manifest.template.md` (the
      portable template; ASF header prepended per the sibling convention — the one sanctioned
      local touch, matching how every references/ file carries it).
      - Caveat, disclosed for the PR: the canon text was transcribed from the user's message,
        not copied from a master file — the user should eyeball the SKILL.md diff against the
        master before merge. Canon defect FILED (manifest Debug): the spine's *Model
        assumption* carries a "For this repo ... single-agent default" instantiation artifact;
        not patched locally, does not bind (manifest + CLAUDE.md win).
- [x] **2. Manifest re-instantiated** — `skills/sepmo/binding-manifest.md` rebuilt per the
      template protocol: role rows all BIND (existing homes), `spine_version: v2.2`, tunables
      bound (two-tier `green_commands` + CI-only exception record + parity-guard-absence
      justification, `severity_floor: S2` raise with provenance, hard-break
      `context_break_mechanics`, `s0_fresh_execution: N/A` per the standing hard break,
      `metrics_ledger_location: task/sepmo-metrics.md`, `taxonomy_extensions: java-parity +
      format-stability`), instantiation checklist I-1…I-10 proven.
      - Note: `severity_floor: S2` is bar-PRESERVING (the old install blocked MEDIUM+ ≈ S2),
        so it lands at instantiation under the asymmetric feed-forward rule rather than
        waiting for a retrospective; provenance stamped in the row.
- [x] **3. Reference amendments** (the v2.1 + v2.2 required sets + spine coherence): 01
      proposition ledger + enumeration obligation + reworked examples; 02 PRE_EXECUTION_REVIEW
      / states renumbered / S-scale / LIGHT-STANDARD rubric / R3 input restriction / R7
      readiness incl. pre-merge gate + exception record; 03 doubles as the one-time
      pre-execution review format; 04 per-element pinning + R5 regression proof + R6
      dispositions; 05 canonical taxonomy + coverage attestation + span check + fresh-execution
      step + S-scale; 06 Invariant V reframe + unledgered-claim/silent-gate-skip watch items;
      07 state 5 + R8 embedded-evidence verification + flag disclosure; 08 metrics ledger
      (incl. `environment_drift_events`) + incident retrospective + asymmetric feed-forward.
- [x] **4. New artifacts + navigation** — CREATE `task/sepmo-metrics.md` (the bound metrics
      ledger, ref-08 metric set, no sections yet — first one lands with the first
      retrospective; the 2026-07-11 nightly-interop CI failure is pre-named as the first
      `environment_drift_events` candidate); refresh `skills/sepmo/map.md` in the same change.
      Fixed in passing (in-scope files): two pre-existing broken `../../CLAUDE.md` links in
      the refs 04/05 repo-note boxes (needed three levels up from `references/`).
- [x] **5. Gate + independent Critic → push** — DONE 2026-07-13: round-2 re-attestation
      **CONVERGED** — the Critic independently re-ran all four gates green on b440629b,
      re-executed the no-default-features compile itself (exit 0, byte-identical to
      ci.yml:149), re-swept every `row *…*` citation to resolution, and re-falsified I-4
      (now true). One NEW S3 advisory filed and accepted-open (F-SEPMO22-3: exception
      entry 5 over-states the platform residual — CI's `tests` job is ubuntu-only, so the
      gap belongs to build/no-default-features + check-on-macOS; conservative-direction
      error, "never blocks" per the spine; tighten at the next touch of the row —
      disclosed in the PR body). Pushed; merge is the user's. Meta-note worth keeping:
      round 1's S1 was the new machinery catching a real binding defect in its own
      install — the R7 silent-skip rule fired on the very unit that introduced it.
      - Round 1 (2026-07-13): Critic CHANGES_REQUIRED with 2 findings, both fixed same day —
        **F-SEPMO22-1 (S1, binding defect):** CI's `build_with_no_default_features` job was
        neither mirrored nor excepted; REMEDIATED by adding
        `cargo build -p iceberg --no-default-features` to the pre-merge gate (run live:
        green, 20.8s) + a fifth exception entry (non-Linux runners platform residual).
        **F-SEPMO22-2 (S2):** three reference citations still named the old manifest row
        `Capability status (SSOT)` after the template-aligned rename; REMEDIATED to
        `Status SSOT` (refs 02 ×1, 07 ×2; repo-wide grep now clean). Regression proof for
        both is structural (grep + live command), not test-expressible — R5 justification.
        Sent back for re-attestation.

## ACTIVE UNIT (2026-07-10): AUDIT TIER 1 Mode B bundle — A1→A3→A2→A4, one branch, one PR

User-approved 2026-07-10 triage of the external five-agent audit (run on the overnight branch;
orchestrator spot-verified all four roots in-tree before scoping). Full ladder-ready briefs:
[audit-2026-07-10-tier1-tier3-briefs.md](audit-2026-07-10-tier1-tier3-briefs.md) — the briefs
file is the spec; this section is the tracker. **Mode B** per [pr-per-work-cycle]: one bundle
branch `fix/audit-tier1-2026-07`, four SEQUENTIAL parity-increment ladders, orchestrator
gates+commits after each unit, ONE final independent SEPMO bundle Critic over the whole branch
diff; push on CONVERGED; single PR. Execution order **A1 → A3 → A2 → A4** (small corruption
fixes first; A4 last — it loosens a must-match guard and deserves the freshest scrutiny).
Tier 3 (ops) already landed separately as `infra/audit-ops-2026-07` (Critic CONVERGED, pushed).
Contingency: a unit whose ladder cannot converge is parked on `fix/audit-tier1-parked-A<n>`
and the bundle resets to the last good commit; the bundle ships with the units that converged.

- [x] **A1 — zero-width / oversized partition transforms** (BUG-001/SAF-001/BUG-013): reject
  `bucket[N]`/`truncate[W]` outside `1..=i32::MAX` at parse per Java preconditions; kill the
  `rem_euclid(0)` panic and the `mod_n as i32` wrap; defense-in-depth typed error at apply.
  - Outcome (ladder SHIP_WITH_NITS, 0 remediation rounds, mutations 5/5 RED, 16 tests): three
    independent doors — `Transform::validate()` in FromStr (the ONLY serde route, so metadata/
    spec/sort-order/manifest deserialization all covered), fallible `Bucket::new`/
    `Truncate::new` at the apply door (deliberately duplicated guards), and both
    partition-spec builders. `Bucket` now stores `mod_n: i32` (checked at construction;
    `bucket_n` cast-free). Java precondition text pinned verbatim from 1.10.0 jar bytecode;
    `Transforms.fromString` parses via Java int, confirming the 1..=i32::MAX parity bound.
    Crown jewel: hostile table-metadata JSON with `bucket[0]`/`bucket[2147483648]` fails at
    deserialization with DataInvalid (control `bucket[16]` parses). Argued deviation: the
    Java message text is asserted at the PartitionSpec serde door, not TableMetadata level
    (untagged-enum serde swallows inner messages; kind stays DataInvalid there).
- [x] **A3 — negative/null position-delete positions** (BUG-005): fail closed with DataInvalid
  at `caching_delete_file_loader.rs` (3 sites + a `.unwrap()`); checked `u64::try_from`.
  CLOSED: ladder SHIP, 0 remediation rounds, critic mutations 5/5 — details in the builder
  notes below (audit's :918 claim corrected: test-oracle code, not production).
    - Builder plan (2026-07-10, live-audited): the audit's ":918 `.unwrap() as u64`" site is
      INSIDE `#[cfg(test)]` (the M5 per-row reference oracle), NOT a production path — and the
      production null guard already exists (L516-522, typed DataInvalid, but names neither the
      delete file nor the column). Real production bugs = the two `pos as u64` wraps
      (L526/L537). Java oracle (source + 1.10.0 jar bytecode): `BitmapPositionDeleteIndex.
      delete(long)` → `RoaringPositionBitmap.set` → `validatePosition`
      (RoaringPositionBitmap.java L311-316) throws IllegalArgumentException for pos < 0;
      `pos` is a REQUIRED column (MetadataColumns.java L70-74) and Java NPEs unboxing a null
      (Deletes.java L146). Plan: (1) thread `delete_file_path` into
      `parse_positional_deletes_record_batch_stream` for error context; (2) split the null
      let-else into per-column typed errors naming the delete file; (3) per-branch checked
      conversion via a `checked_delete_position` helper (kept per-site so each brief-mandated
      mutation stays independently RED); (4) fix the test-module reference oracle's bare
      unwraps; (5) tests: negative-in-run (L526 pin), negative-first-row (L537 pin),
      null-position via the FULL `load_deletes` production path, null-file-path direct-parse
      pin, happy-path control including boundary pos=0 (over-broaden direction). Named
      divergence to record in-test: Java also caps positions at MAX_POSITION
      (0x7FFF_FFFE_8000_0000, roaring key-space); Rust RoaringTreemap takes full u64 — only
      the negative bound is ported.
    - Builder outcome (2026-07-10, pre-critic): LANDED as planned — per-site
      `checked_delete_position` (both insert branches), split null let-else guards naming
      the delete file + column, `delete_file_path` threaded, test-oracle unwraps fixed.
      5 new tests (2 negative-site pins via the FULL `load_deletes` parquet path, null-pos
      full-path, null-file-path direct-parse, pos=0 boundary control), 5 mutations ALL
      independently RED (mutation 2's failure output showed the exact corruption:
      RoaringTreemap<[18446744073709551611]>). Gate green: typos/fmt/clippy -D warnings/
      lib 2745×2 (+5 over the A1 baseline 2740); `cargo test -p iceberg-datafusion` unit+
      integration green (the one doc-test FAIL is a pre-existing `#[tokio::main]`
      rt-multi-thread feature-unification artifact of `-p` isolation, untouched crate).
      Flagged, not fixed (scope): L298 `task.equality_ids.clone().unwrap()` (production
      bare unwrap, eq-delete column — not a position/path column); Java's MAX_POSITION
      upper bound not mirrored (named in doc + test comments).
- [x] **A2 — Fixed/Binary single-value JSON** (BUG-004/OTH-007): implement both `todo!()` arms
  per Java `SingleValueParser`/spec Appendix D; verify emit case vs Java base16 (possible
  two-sided interop bug); Fixed length enforcement.
  CLOSED: ladder SHIP, critic mutations 7/7, zero `todo!()` left in spec/values/ — details in
  the builder notes below. Orchestrator notes: the round-trip test alone CANNOT catch an emit
  case flip (parse is case-insensitive per Java) — the exact-emit-string test is the sole
  case pin; round-2 remediation fired on the harness out-of-scope matcher false positive
  (tests.rs vs the `spec/values/` directory allow entry) with an EMPTY issue list —
  verification-only round, 2 mutations re-proven RED, no code changed after round 0.
    - Builder outcome (2026-07-10, pre-critic): CONFIRMED two-sided — the old emit catch-all
      was `{x:x}` (lowercase AND unpadded: 0x0A → "a", undecodable by Java's strict
      `BaseEncoding.base16()`). Both `try_from_json` arms implemented (mixed-case accept per
      Java `toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT)`, SingleValueParser.java L169/L175; Fixed pre-decode
      string-length == 2·L check per L160-167); emit replaced with explicit Fixed
      (length-enforced per L331-337) + Binary arms, UPPERCASE `{b:02X}`; other
      (type, Binary) combos now fall to the DataInvalid catch-all (was: silently hex-encoded
      under any type). 6 new tests incl. the crown-jewel Java-written schema-with-defaults
      deserialization (previously PANICKED via `SerdeNestedField`); 7 mutations ALL
      independently RED (error-arm, case-flip, pad-drop, parse+emit length-check drops,
      odd-length accept, non-hex-as-0, over-broadened/inverted length guard — both
      directions per testing.md). Java fixtures from `TestSingleValueParser` L53-54,
      L117-123. Gate green: typos/fmt/clippy -D warnings/lib 2751×2 (+6 over A3's 2745).
      Flagged, not fixed (scope): `SerdeNestedField→NestedField` swallows parse errors via
      `.ok()` (malformed default hex now yields default=None silently, panic before —
      pre-existing seam behavior for all types); `hex_str_to_bytes` duplicates
      `expr/expression_parser.rs::hex_to_bytes` (out-of-scope file, dedup deferred);
      interop round-trip vs a live Java oracle deferred (🟡 done-bar).
    - Remediation r1 (2026-07-10): critic issue list parsed EMPTY and no report file found —
      instead of guessing, independently re-verified the increment: all four hex arms
      bytecode-confirmed against the 1.10.0 `SingleValueParser.class` line table (fromJson
      FIXED length-precheck + `toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT)` decode at offsets 576-643, BINARY
      644-678; toJson FIXED `remaining()==length()` check + `base16().encode` at 455-520,
      BINARY 523-552); 3 spot mutations re-run RED (emit case-flip, emit + parse Fixed
      length-check drops) with byte-identical restore; full gate re-run green (lib 2751×2).
      No code changes this round.
    - Remediation r2 (2026-07-10): issue list parsed EMPTY again; searched scratchpad +
      task/ — no critic report file exists anywhere. Self-critique of the accumulated diff
      found no open defect (no `todo!()` remains; non-Fixed/Binary `(type, Binary)` combos
      fall to the DataInvalid catch-all; `is_multiple_of` is within MSRV 1.92). 2 mutations
      re-run RED (emit case-flip → `json_binary_fixed_emit_uppercase_padded_java_compatible`
      RED; parse-side Fixed length check disabled via `if false &&` →
      `json_fixed_length_mismatch_is_data_invalid` RED), restored byte-identical (`cmp`
      verified). Full gate re-run green (typos/fmt/clippy -D warnings/lib 2751×2). No code
      changes this round.
- [x] **A4 — StrictMetricsEvaluator absent-NaN inversion** (found by our G4): absent NaN
  counts ⇒ CANNOT contain, matching Java cell-by-cell; over-loosening pin required; close the
  ENGINE_CONTRACT §9 open item in the same change.
    - Outcome (2026-07-10): `may_contain_nan` absent arm flipped to CANNOT (Java
      `canContainNaNs` 1.10.0 L483-486, jar-bytecode-verified: absent map/key ⇒ `iconst_0`);
      the Java `gtEq` NaN-lower-bound guard (L285-291, bytecode offsets 93-105) that the
      loosening makes REACHABLE ported in the same change — `Datum` orders NaN largest
      (`total_cmp`), so without it `NaN >= x` would wrongly prove ROWS_MUST_MATCH (the
      over-claim/data-loss direction). Every helper consumer matched cell-by-cell vs the Java
      visitor (lt/ltEq/gt/gtEq/eq/in consult the pair guard; notEq/notIn/isNaN/notNaN use the
      containsOnly helpers — all match). 5 new tests: crown-jewel int-column provable sweep
      (RED pre-fix), eq+in absent-arm consumers, over-loosening guard across all 5 consumers
      (nan_count>0 + bounds that would otherwise prove), float-absent Java-verdict pin
      (MUST_MATCH, bytecode-provenance), NaN-poisoned-bounds never-prove pin. 3 mutations RED
      (absent-arm revert / nan>0-arm drop / gtEq-guard drop), byte-identical restore.
      NAMED findings (recorded, NOT fixed here): (1) `may_contain_null` diverges from Java
      `canContainNulls` in the map-present-key-ABSENT case (Java: cannot; Rust: may —
      conservative/under-fires; Rust's single HashMap cannot represent Java's null-map vs
      empty-map split); (2) Rust has NO `isNestedColumn` short-circuit (Java returns
      MIGHT_NOT_MATCH for nested columns in every arm). §9 bullet closed. Deferred: the
      cross-engine metrics-decided full-match interop sweep (done-bar 🟡).
- [x] **A5 — bundle close**: independent SEPMO bundle Critic over `main..HEAD` → on CONVERGED
  flip this section, push, PR body to scratchpad.
  - Outcome (2026-07-10): bundle Critic **CONVERGED**, ZERO findings, NO units parked. Gate
    re-run in full by the Critic (typos/fmt/clippy/lib 2756/matrix-anchors/agent-artifacts);
    4/4 cross-unit mutations re-proven RED with byte-identical restores; Java citations for
    all four units re-verified against the 1.10.0 reference (incl. confirming `greater_than`
    already had its NaN guard on main — A4 correctly added only the missing gtEq one);
    behavioral-break sweep ruled the A2 emit change and A1 rejections corrections TOWARD the
    Java-written format, not format breaks (no in-tree dependents of the old behavior). Two
    accepted LOWs: the narrow pre-existing-in-kind serialize `.expect` surface in
    datatypes.rs:691 for malformed in-memory defaults (the flagged `.ok()` seam's sibling —
    future unit), and cosmetic `bind().unwrap()` in A4 test helpers matching module
    convention. Pushed `fix/audit-tier1-2026-07`; PR body at scratchpad
    `pr-body-audit-tier1-2026-07.md`. Tier 3 companion branch `infra/audit-ops-2026-07`
    (Critic CONVERGED after 2 MEDIUM prose corrections) pushed earlier the same day.

## ACTIVE UNIT (2026-07-09): OVERNIGHT Mode B bundle — G1→G4, one branch, one PR

User-directed 2026-07-09 ("run G1 to G4 in sequential groups without needing a PR for each") —
**Mode B** per [pr-per-work-cycle]: one bundle branch `parity/overnight-2026-07-09`, four
SEQUENTIAL parity-increment ladders (each: builder → tailored Opus critic, mutation-gated →
independent gate → bounded remediation), the orchestrator gates+commits after each unit, then ONE
final independent SEPMO bundle Critic over the whole branch diff; push on CONVERGED; single PR
for the user in the morning. Execution order **G1 → G2 → G4 → G3** (G3 last so the nightly
workflow enumerates any interop suites G4 adds). Statuses live ONLY in the GAP_MATRIX.

- [x] **G1. CDC row-level changelog** (queue item 2; rows R122/R123 named residue) —
      `ChangelogOperation::{UpdateBefore, UpdateAfter}` + handling ranges that carry row-level
      DELETE manifests (today: `FeatureUnsupported`, matching Java's data-file changelog).
      JAVA-FIRST scoping is mandatory: decode what 1.10.0 CORE (`BaseIncrementalChangelogScan`)
      actually defines vs what lives Spark-side (`ChangelogIterator` net-change pairing is NOT
      core) — parity claims only for the core surface; anything beyond is engine-first and
      labeled so (DML-foundation direction). Done bar: partial (interop slice may defer).
    - Builder plan (2026-07-09, bytecode-audited): 1.10.0 core REJECTS every delete-manifest
      range (`javap` offsets 86–95) and never constructs `BaseDeletedRowsScanTask` — so
      row-level acceptance is ENGINE-FIRST behind an opt-in builder flag
      (`with_row_level_deletes`), default = exact Java rejection surface. Port the api
      taxonomy as core parity: `ChangelogOperation` gains `UpdateBefore`/`UpdateAfter`
      (declared, never emitted by the planner — pairing is Spark-side, DEFERRED);
      `ChangelogScanTask` gains `kind` (AddedRows/DeletedDataFile/DeletedRows, operation()
      derived) + `added_deletes`/`existing_deletes`. Row-level planning per snapshot: split
      its delete manifests into added-in-S vs pre-existing `DeleteFileIndex`es; own-added
      data entries → AddedRows (with added deletes)/DeletedDataFile (with existing deletes);
      live NOT-added-in-S data files hit by added deletes → DeletedRows (added+existing
      split). Tests: crown-jewel MoR chain mirroring the `DeletedDataFileScanTask` javadoc
      example, added-vs-preexisting split, same-snapshot fold, pure-append control,
      replace-consumes-no-ordinal, rejection unchanged. Arrow read: no core-defined
      semantics (reading is engine-side) — AddedRows/DeletedDataFile tasks readable via the
      existing MoR `FileScanTask.deletes` machinery; DeletedRows projection deferred.
      Outcome (2026-07-09): LANDED as planned — `scan/task.rs` taxonomy (breaking:
      `ChangelogScanTask.operation` field → `kind`, `operation()` now derived; 2 new enum
      variants break downstream exhaustive matches), `scan/incremental.rs` planner
      (opt-in row-level mode; default path output-identical, guard mutation-proven both
      ways), 6 new/extended tests + 6 targeted mutations ALL RED
      (guard-disable / added-existing-swap / fold-drop / ordinal-reverse / kind-swap /
      commit-misstamp), R123 residue re-written (matrix gate green, 71 rows), R122
      untouched (no row-level residue lives there), scan/map.md refreshed. Deferred:
      interop slice (Java oracle for the row-level mode is meaningless — 1.10.0 core
      cannot plan those ranges; the existing data-file changelog interop stands as the
      control), DeletedRows Arrow projection (engine-side), UPDATE_BEFORE/UPDATE_AFTER
      pairing (Spark-side, not core parity).
- [x] **G2. Reconciliation-by-refresh** (R157 residue; `BaseMetastoreTableOperations.
      checkCommitStatus` / `CommitStatus` SUCCESS·FAILURE·UNKNOWN) — on `CommitStateUnknown`,
      re-read the catalog with bounded retries and decide landed (⇒ success) / absent (⇒ real
      failure, re-thrown per Java) / still-unknown (⇒ surface unknown). Mock tests for all three
      outcomes; the credentialed real-catalog slice stays with queue item 6.
      Outcome (2026-07-09): LANDED with one JAVA-FIRST rescope — the brief's "absent ⇒ re-thrown
      CommitFailed" is NOT 1.10.0 production behavior: the only production callers (Glue L174,
      DynamoDb L136) use the NON-strict `checkCommitStatus`, which converts strict-FAILURE ⇒
      UNKNOWN (bytecode offsets 11-34; `checkCommitStatusStrict` has zero non-test callers)
      because a pending in-flight request may still land after the check — declaring failure and
      re-running is the double-commit corruption class. Shipped: `transaction/commit_status.rs`
      (strict classifier, `commit.status-check.*` knobs with Java names/defaults, n+1 attempts,
      2.0-factor clamped backoff) + `Transaction::reconcile_unknown_commit_outcome` (non-strict
      conversion at the catalog-agnostic seam; snapshot-id evidence searched in the reloaded
      snapshot SET — history-tolerant to concurrent writers). 11 new/updated tests (crown jewel
      reconciles-to-success-without-reapply; buried-under-concurrent-writer; absent ⇒ unknown
      never success/retry; bounded-by-property; CommitFailed-control never reconciles;
      metadata-only skip; invalid-knob surfaces unknown; 4 unit pins) + 7 mutations ALL RED.
      Named divergences (matrix cell + module docs): snapshot-id evidence vs Java's
      metadata-location; metadata-only commits not reconciled; REST/SQL unknowns also reconciled
      (Java's REST/JDBC ops never do — strictly outcome-improving, read-only). R157 stays 🟡
      (credentialed slice remains); ENGINE_CONTRACT §8 manual reconciliation downgraded to the
      two residual cases.
- [x] **G4. ENGINE_CONTRACT §5 DRAFT→NORMATIVE** (queue item 4) — verify the isolation-level →
      validation table against Java 1.10.0 `SparkWrite`/`SparkCopyOnWriteOperation`/
      `SparkPositionDeltaWrite` (bytecode where jars exist, else the reference-checkout source —
      cite which); one interop conflict scenario per cell; + the owed non-identity
      DeleteFilter-equivalence test.
      Outcome (2026-07-09): §5 flipped NORMATIVE — every cell verified against the
      `apache-iceberg-1.10.0` SOURCE (Spark jars absent from `~/.m2`; oracle form cited per
      cell; api/core surfaces additionally javap-verified). TWO cells CORRECTED: (1) MoR DELETE
      does NOT enable `validate_deleted_files` (UPDATE/MERGE-only, `SparkPositionDeltaWrite`
      L251-254) — the draft prescribed it; (2) `case_sensitive` is NOT part of the Java base
      recipe (neither Spark writer calls it — engine policy). Base clarified: MoR
      `validate_data_files_exist` is unconditional (all commands, both isolation levels, L243);
      scan==null ⇒ NO validation; static overwrite-by-filter rows ADDED (`OverwriteByFilter`).
      Per-cell covering scenarios cited (C1-C5 interop arc + named unit tests); NEW
      `engine_contract_isolation_recipes.rs` pins the serializable-vs-snapshot distinction
      behaviorally for BOTH modes (snapshot leg COMMITS + post-commit live set; serializable leg
      REJECTS naming the validation; 3 recipe mutations RED). Owed non-identity DeleteFilter
      test LANDED (`test_engine_deletefilter_nonidentity_partition_equivalence`, offline
      truncate[10](id) pos+eq deletes, production-mutation RED). §9 R157 bullet un-staled
      (reconciliation-by-refresh landed G2). No matrix row touched.
      Remediation 2 (2026-07-09): the unit-only residue CLOSED — NEW cross-engine suite
      `interop_s5_isolation_conflict.rs` + `S5IsolationOracle` + `run-interop-s5-isolation.sh`
      covers the three formerly unit-level cells (COW/snapshot deletes, dynamic-overwrite/
      snapshot, static overwrite-by-filter snapshot+serializable): 8 scenarios (4 REJECT +
      4 ACCEPT guards), BOTH directions green + sabotage fail-closed on the local Java 11 run;
      4 recipe mutations RED (each cell's isolation-distinguishing validation dropped ⇒ GEN
      self-check fails). FOUND + NAMED (out of increment file scope, ENGINE_CONTRACT §9 open
      item): Rust `StrictMetricsEvaluator::may_contain_nan` treats ABSENT nan counts as
      may-contain-NaN (Java `canContainNaNs` 1.10.0 L483-486: absent ⇒ CANNOT), so strict
      inequalities never prove a full match on non-float columns —
      `overwrite_by_row_filter`/`DeleteFiles`-by-filter rejects ("some, but not all, rows
      match") files Java deletes cleanly; the serializable by-filter interop cell therefore
      runs partition-scoped (`category = "a"`) to keep `validate_no_conflicting_data`
      load-bearing. Follow-up: fix `expr/visitors/strict_metrics_evaluator.rs` L105-111 +
      an interop pin on a metrics-decided full-match sweep.
- [x] **G3. Nightly interop CI** (queue item 5) — scheduled workflow running the
      `dev/java-interop/` suites unprompted (cron precedent: audit/codeql/stale.yml); enumerate
      suites, doc the runner requirements (Java/protoc/docker), local one-shot proof of the
      entry point; the "runs unprompted" proof is next night's run.
      Outcome (2026-07-10): LANDED — `scripts/run_interop_suites.sh` (dynamic glob discovery,
      floor 48 with ratchet-on-add rule, prereq HARD-FAIL never-skip, continue-across-suites
      per-suite PASS/FAIL summary + step summary, `--only` local subset flag that logs every
      exclusion, `--selftest` battery), `make interop`/`interop-selftest`,
      `.github/workflows/nightly_interop.yml` (cron 06:43 UTC + workflow_dispatch; apt JDK 11 +
      `/opt/maven` symlink because all 48 suites default to those paths — 47 hardcode them
      outright, only `run-interop-aggregate.sh` reads `$MVN`/`$JAVA_HOME` — and must not be
      modified; online `~/.m2` priming because 47 of 48 suites run `mvn -o` (only
      `run-interop-scan-exec.sh` is online); full set only — no subset flag or env hook
      reachable from the YAML), map.md/README rows. Proofs: selftest 9/9 green + 7 driver
      mutations RED (exit-on-fail / floor / prereq / exclusion-log / empty-`--only` /
      empty-run-set / fake-prereq-wiring guards each turn a case red); real-dir battery —
      planted failing suite ⇒ exit 1 with the other suite still run+reported, renamed suite ⇒
      floor error before running anything, PATH-without-cargo + void-mvn ⇒ prereq hard-fail,
      YAML safe_load green + broken-copy red (non-vacuous); GREEN real-suite subset runs
      exit 0, 48 discovered. Remediation R1 (2026-07-10; critic report unrecoverable ⇒
      self-audit): (1) `--only ""` silently ran the FULL set (bounded request became
      unbounded — reproduced live) ⇒ parse-time hard-fail + selftest ST7; (2) a zero-suite
      run greened ("0 passed, 0 failed" ⇒ exit 0, reachable via the floor-0 test hooks) ⇒
      empty-run-set guard in `run_suites` + ST8; (3) the selftest was NOT hermetic (needed a
      real `/opt/maven` + JDK 11 on the machine) ⇒ fake prereqs wired through `drive()`,
      ST3 now isolates ONE missing prereq per case, wiring mutation-proven (6 cases red when
      the fake mvn path is broken); (4) `--help` used a hardcoded `sed '19,66p'` line range
      that drifts on any header edit ⇒ marker-based awk; (5) corrected wrong counts shipped
      in 5 places (was "29 hardcode / 19 offline"; measured truth: 48 default, 47 hardcode
      outright, 47/48 offline). NAMED RESIDUE: the
      "runs unprompted" proof is inherently NEXT night's live run (cron fires only once this
      file is on the default branch); the CI-runner provisioning (apt/symlink/m2-priming +
      the 350-min job bound vs the full 48-suite wall time) is NOT locally verifiable — first
      nightly is the proof. Deferred: `run.sh` + `run-inspection-manifests.sh` (outside the
      `run-interop-*.sh` glob, named in map.md/README); no log artifact upload (step summary
      only — no pinned upload-artifact action precedent in this repo). Remediation R2
      (2026-07-10; critic verdict SHIP — 5/5 mutations caught, zero bugs/over-claims; closed
      its one named test-strength nit): ST1's failing fake sorted LAST, so a
      bookkeeping-clean abort-on-first-failure mutation greened the whole battery 9/9
      (reproduced live — worse than the critic's own summary-needle-caught variant); renamed
      it `run-interop-aa-fail.sh` (sorts FIRST, before both passers), so the a/b `.ran`
      marker check now pins continue-AFTER-failure directly, independent of summary wording;
      the same mutation goes RED at 2 checks post-fix, clean battery 9/9 green. The critic's
      two blind-spot claims were resolution:refuted by its own probes (bash>=4.4 empty-array
      expansion; an independent sort-first continue-across probe against production).
    - Builder plan (2026-07-10, live-audited): 48 `run-interop-*.sh` suites exist (the brief
      said ~31 — floor set to the LIVE count 48); 29 hardcode `/opt/maven/bin/mvn` +
      `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64` and 19 run `mvn -o` (offline ⇒ CI must
      prime `~/.m2`) [counts corrected in R1: those greps were style-narrow — truth is 48
      default / 47 hardcode outright / 47 of 48 offline], so the workflow installs apt
      `openjdk-11-jdk-headless` (noble carries
      11.0.31) + `maven` and symlinks `/opt/maven` rather than setup-java (the suites must
      not be modified). Deliverables: `scripts/run_interop_suites.sh` (dynamic glob discovery
      + floor 48 + hard-fail prereqs + continue-across-suites + per-suite PASS/FAIL summary +
      step summary + `--only` LOCAL subset flag that logs exclusions + `--selftest` sabotage
      battery), `make interop`/`interop-selftest`, `.github/workflows/nightly_interop.yml`
      (cron + workflow_dispatch, full set only — no subset flag reachable), map.md/README
      rows, local green subset proof + sabotage battery RED proofs. No matrix row touched
      (infra; no capability status changes).
- [x] **G5. Bundle close** — DONE 2026-07-10: independent SEPMO bundle Critic (fresh context,
      Opus) over `main..HEAD` **CONVERGED**, zero HIGH/MEDIUM findings ("Recommendation:
      push"). Cross-unit checks all clean: G1's breaking `ChangelogScanTask` change has ZERO
      external consumers (workspace-wide grep + build); G2's reconciliation composes correctly
      with the #144 unknown-kind retry gate (absent ⇒ original error, Java non-strict); all 7
      spot-checked §5 citations resolve; G3's floor (48) matches the live suite count incl.
      G4's new suite; todo notes accurate. 3 cross-unit mutations re-proven RED. 2 LOWs
      accepted (selftest count understated 9→10; interop coverage disclosed as
      claim-of-existence pending Java/Maven + first nightly). Pushed; merge is the user's.
      NO groups parked — the contingency was never needed.

CONTINGENCY (unattended): if a group's ladder cannot converge (workflow remediation exhausted +
one orchestrator remediation), park its work on `parity/overnight-parked-G<n>`, reset the bundle
branch to the last good unit commit (own unpushed branch; work preserved on the parked branch),
continue the chain, and report the parked group in the morning. Gate note (2026-07-08): the
typos step excludes the two untracked scratch briefs (`.typos.toml` decision still the user's).

## DONE 2026-07-08 (merged #144): queue item 1 — commit-outcome taxonomy (row R157)

User-directed 2026-07-08 ("proceed with your recommendation"). One PR, branch
`parity/commit-state-unknown`. Ladder: parity-increment workflow (builder → tailored adversarial
critic, mutation-gated → verification gate → bounded remediation), then the independent SEPMO
Critic before push. Status flips live ONLY in the GAP_MATRIX (row R157).

- [x] **1. Unknown-outcome error class** — `ErrorKind::CommitStateUnknown` (`error.rs`) +
      `Transaction::commit`'s gate refuses the KIND regardless of the `retryable` flag (Java
      1.10.0 bytecode: `onlyRetryOn(CommitFailedException.class)` + dedicated
      `CommitStateUnknownException` rethrow ahead of the cleanup catch). Gate mutation-proven
      BOTH directions (flag-only gate + unknown-retried gate each turn a pin red).
- [x] **2. Sent-vs-unsent transport classification** — REST (`query_catalog_for_commit`
      transport split + 500/502/503/504 ⇒ unknown + 200-with-lost-response ⇒ unknown, tables
      AND views), SQL (`from_sqlx_commit_error`: Io/Protocol/WorkerCrashed ⇒ unknown; CAS
      conflict stays retryable; NOTE — the previously-DISCARDED SQL-transaction `COMMIT` error
      now propagates for all statements), Glue + S3 Tables (`SdkError` dispatch classification
      + `InternalService`/`OperationTimeout`/`InternalServerError` ⇒ unknown;
      `ConcurrentModification`/`Conflict` stay retryable). REST/SQL/Glue classifiers
      mutation-proven.
- [x] **3. Mock-catalog tests** — crown jewel (`transaction/mod.rs`): durably-landed-but-
      unacknowledged commit against a real in-memory catalog ⇒ surfaced intact, exactly 1
      `update_table` call, exactly 1 snapshot, file appears ONCE, manifests NOT cleaned up;
      + flag-defense test (unknown-with-retryable-flag still not retried); + Error API
      kind-survives-wrapping test; existing retryable/terminal tests unchanged (control pins).
- [x] **4. Rider: crates/ citation migration** — 26 bare-citation sites migrated across ~24
      files (each target row VERIFIED by cell content — drift was NOT uniformly +2: e.g.
      93/94/95→R105/R106/R107, 100→R100, 129→R129, 152→R152, builder-flips 134/135→R146
      merged row); `crates` added to check-4's pathspec AND the asserted scan-target list;
      anchor grep made case-sensitive on the `R` (test prose "rows r1" false-positive);
      red-proof: planted a dead `R9999` anchor citation in a crates/ comment ⇒ gate exits
      non-zero; removed ⇒ green.
- [x] **5. Matrix + docs** — row R157 flipped ❌→🟡 (2026-07-08; residue named:
      reconciliation-by-refresh `checkCommitStatus` NOT ported, credentialed slice with queue
      item 6); ENGINE_CONTRACT §8 rewritten around catching `ErrorKind::CommitStateUnknown`
      (mitigation (a)-(c) stands until reconciliation lands); `make check-matrix-anchors`
      green (71 rows).
- [x] **R1. Remediation rounds 1–2 (2026-07-08)** — (a) typos: round 1 reworded 7
      typos-cli-1.47.2 false-positives in the untracked scratch briefs
      `task/a1-cow-partition-brief.md` + `task/h7-dml-streaming-scope.md`; round 2 REVERTED
      that as out-of-scope (user scratch, not increment files). RESOLUTION: the commit gate
      runs `typos` over TRACKED files (exactly what CI certifies on a clean checkout — the
      untracked briefs never enter any commit); a `.typos.toml` exclude vs rewording the
      briefs is the user's call (flagged in the PR); (b) the REST 200-with-unparsable-body
      OK arms are now PINNED:
      `test_update_table_200_unparsable_body_maps_to_commit_state_unknown` (full
      `Transaction::commit` stack, POST `expect(1)`) +
      `test_update_view_200_unparsable_body_maps_to_commit_state_unknown` — both
      mutation-proven RED on OK-arm kind → `Unexpected`, green restored (REST lib 64→66).
- [x] **6. Gate + independent Critic → push** — DONE 2026-07-08: gate green in ONE chain with
      commit 4bffcc82 (typos·fmt·clippy -D warnings·lib tests 2706/66/74/23/26·both integrity
      gates); independent SEPMO Critic (fresh context, Opus) **CONVERGED** — bytecode-verified
      the Java contract (`onlyRetryOn(CommitFailedException.class)`; unknown rethrown ahead of
      cleanup; 409→CommitFailed, 500/502/503/504→unknown), 6/6 mutations RED, ALL rider
      citations content-verified, zero blocking findings (2 LOWs accepted: REST-test bare
      unwraps house-consistent; 200-unparsable-body arm is a disclosed safer-than-Java
      extension). Pushed; merge is the user's.

## ACTIVE (2026-07-01): Engine-first closeout — re-ranked open queue

Supersedes the 2026-06-13 queue below. **One home for PRIORITY: this list** (the Roadmap's
re-anchor carries a "Priority home" pointer here; do not grow ranked lists elsewhere). Re-ranked
after the 2026-07-01 review pass, which reconciled the old queue (most items had landed) and
surfaced two new items. Statuses live ONLY in
[docs/parity/GAP_MATRIX.md](../docs/parity/GAP_MATRIX.md).

- [ ] **1. Commit-outcome taxonomy (`CommitStateUnknown`)** — NEW, GAP_MATRIX row R157. An
      unknown-outcome `ErrorKind` (or flag) honored by the retry gate + sent-vs-unsent
      transport-error classification in the Glue / S3 Tables / REST / SQL catalogs +
      surfaced-no-retry-no-cleanup semantics matching Java + mock-catalog tests. Buildable
      WITHOUT AWS creds. Slots ahead of CDC: the named consumer commits continuously against
      S3 Tables, whose service-side maintenance ALSO commits concurrently — an ambiguous outcome
      today risks a duplicate commit (see the row cell). The credentialed conformance slice
      stays with item 6.
- [ ] **2. CDC row-level changelog** (re-anchor item 2) — `UpdateBefore`/`UpdateAfter` + accepting
      ranges that carry row-level DELETE manifests (`IncrementalChangelogScan` is
      whole-data-file-level today).
- [ ] **3. ORC/Avro DATA-read residue** (re-anchor item 3) — footer codec / nested + V3 types /
      the Avro `timestamptz` mapping — pull only if the engine queries non-parquet tables.
- [ ] **4. ENGINE_CONTRACT.md recipes → NORMATIVE** — bytecode/oracle-verify the
      isolation-level → validation table (DRAFT landed 2026-07-01,
      [docs/ENGINE_CONTRACT.md](../docs/ENGINE_CONTRACT.md)) against Java 1.10.0
      `SparkWrite` / `SparkCopyOnWriteOperation` / `SparkPositionDeltaWrite`, one interop
      conflict scenario per cell.
- [ ] **5. Nightly interop CI** — run the `dev/java-interop/` suites on a schedule. The oracle is
      the model-tier equalizer only if it runs unprompted; this is the cheap 80% of Phase 7.
- [ ] **6. Real-catalog hardening (credentialed)** — Glue + S3 Tables conflict/retry conformance
      + item 1's real-catalog classification slice; scheduled with the user (needs AWS creds).

**In-flight (off-matrix, user-gated — staged work, not ranked above): H7 DML
streaming/pushdown** on the DataFusion reference impl (scope converged 2026-06-30; engine-first
hardening of the #124 DML loop, flips no matrix row). **H7-S1** (MoR DELETE/UPDATE streaming) is
PUSHED — branch `parity/h7-s1-mor-streaming` (d2fecef6), gate green, all Critics/audits
converged — awaiting user merge. Remaining stages, each its own ladder when the user resumes:
**H7-S2** (COW streaming — the two `copy_on_write_*` fns, two-pass→bounded refactor) and
**H7-P1** (pushdown pruning — must FIRST thread the raw `Vec<Expr>` through both exec structs,
and resolve the `NOT`-over-dropped-conjunct under-delete footgun before any
`with_filter(convert_filters_to_predicate)`; pushdown may ONLY prune, never replace the exact
post-scan filter).

PULL-BASED / DEMOTED: unchanged from the Roadmap re-anchor — link, do not restate.

## ACTIVE UNIT (2026-07-01b): review follow-ups 1+2 — gate needles + stable row anchors

User-directed (2026-07-01, post-merge of #140/#141/#142): implement follow-ups 1 and 2 from the
review-series closeout. One PR, branch `infra/review-followups-2026-07-01`. Also carries the
user's seam-status decision record (datafusion integration promoted to supported product surface —
ENGINE_CONTRACT §1 + Roadmap, committed first as its own decision commit).

- [x] **1. Broaden the artifact gate** (`scripts/check_agent_artifacts.sh`) — Critic LOW-1:
      add the function_results tag family + bare opening tags (`invoke name=` / `parameter name=`,
      concatenation-assembled as before); case-insensitive matching (uppercase variants);
      `<result>`/`<output>` deliberately EXCLUDED as too generic (false-positive risk — document);
      built-in SELF-TEST that plants every needle via a TEMP-COPY index (`GIT_INDEX_FILE`) and
      hard-fails if any needle goes undetected (a gate that cannot detect its own probe is
      vacuous — the sabotage-must-hard-fail doctrine). Red/green re-proof per new needle class.
- [x] **2. Stable matrix row anchors** — the durable fix for [citation drift]. Stamp every
      capability row's first cell with a permanent ID: `| R<n> · <name> |` where n = the row's
      file line number at stamping time (so every live citation just renumbered 2026-07-01 maps
      1:1). New rows take the next unused ID (R158+), insertable anywhere; IDs never reused.
      New `scripts/check_matrix_anchors.sh` (make target + CI step, mirroring the artifacts gate):
      (a) every data row anchored exactly once, (b) IDs unique, (c) every `row R<n>` citation in
      the live docs resolves to an existing anchor, (d) the 5-pipe audit AUTOMATED (was manual
      per CLAUDE.md). Convention note added BELOW the table (zero row-line movement). Sabotage
      proofs: duplicate ID / unstamped row / dead citation / 6-pipe row each proven RED.
- [x] **3. Citation migration** — live docs (Roadmap.md, docs/, todo ACTIVE + the 2026-07-01
      reconciliation lines, CLAUDE.md convention bullet) move to `row R<n>` form; quoted-historical
      spots and dated archives deliberately stay bare-N (they cite historical numbering epochs).
- [x] **4. Verify + Critic** — DONE 2026-07-01: 2-auditor fan-out (287 claims; found the 4th
      drift wave + 8 hardening findings, all fixed) → independent Critic CHANGES REQUIRED
      (1 MEDIUM: check-4 git-grep false-green — fixed c195b616) → re-review CONVERGED. Pushed.

NAMED FOLLOW-UP (Critic LOW, 2026-07-01 — not this PR): ~20 stale bare `GAP_MATRIX row N`
citations live in `crates/` source/test comments (e.g. `scan/task_group.rs`,
`tests/interop_scan_plan.rs`, `aggregate_evaluator.rs`), most drifted under current numbering —
migrate them to `row R<n>` form and add `crates/` to the anchor checker's scan pathspec (touches
Rust files, so it rides a code PR, not this docs/CI one).

## SUPERSEDED 2026-07-01 — was ACTIVE (2026-06-13): Near-full-parity open queue

> Priority now lives ONLY in the 2026-07-01 queue above. This section is retained as the
> reconciliation record; landed items are flipped below with pointers (per this file's own
> flip-the-checkbox rule) — statuses live ONLY in the GAP_MATRIX.

Directive (user, 2026-06-11): run this fork's Roadmap to **almost the full 1:1 Java replacement**.
Waves 3–7 landed PRs #28–#47 (write-engine closeout; maintenance actions end-to-end incl.
Compute{Table,Partition}Stats + the iceberg-sketches crate; the variant arc; stage_only + WAP; views
end-to-end; SQL-catalog CAS; and the theta/view/WAP/partition-stats interop chains). This queue is the
**2026-06-13 re-audit's** ranked next-work; **statuses live ONLY in
[docs/parity/GAP_MATRIX.md](../docs/parity/GAP_MATRIX.md)** — link, do not restate cells.

> **Queue re-audited 2026-06-15 against the live suite + GAP_MATRIX (Opus).** The prior #1
> ("write-action DATA-level interop FIRST") was already DONE — `interop_write_data.rs` +
> `run-interop-write-data.sh` landed the data-level round-trips for delete/overwrite/replace/rewrite
> (+ partitioned) and merge (one-bin + multi-bin), both directions, 2026-06-11 (GAP_MATRIX rows
> 90-95). The residue that actually keeps rows 91-95 at 🟡 is the phrase repeated in every cell:
> **"multi-spec / conflict-validation paths NOT covered."** The queue below is re-ranked to that
> reality. Statuses live ONLY in [docs/parity/GAP_MATRIX.md](../docs/parity/GAP_MATRIX.md).

Ranked, highest-value first:

- [x] **1. Conflict-validation interop** — DONE 2026-06-15/16 (PRs #64–#68; #69 was the
      multi-spec Wave-2 slice, item 2 — range corrected 2026-07-01): proven BOTH
      directions for all 5 write actions (C1 OverwriteFiles first, then DeleteFiles / RowDelta /
      ReplacePartitions / RewriteFiles). Reconciled 2026-07-01 — the checkbox had never been
      flipped.
- [ ] **2. Multi-spec write interop** — STILL OPEN (reconciled 2026-07-01; citations corrected
      same day). TWO distinct residues: (a) the manifest-merge LAYOUT gap —
      `MergeManifestProcess` is not routed into the non-append merging actions (the `RowDelta`
      row, currently row R106 — the old "row 94" pointer was dead); (b) the writer-layer spec
      threading — `DataFileWriter`/`DeletionVectorWriter` stamp the table default spec (row R110)
      — plus the multi-spec-DATA interop slices on the merging actions (one slice landed: #69,
      multi-spec RowDelta DELETE-commit); `fast_append` multi-spec is ✅ (Z2 — the template).
- [x] **3. Builder-surface interop flips** — DONE 2026-06-16: `case_sensitive` +
      `delete_from_row_filter` interop-proven ✅ (the rows this queue numbered 134/135 under the
      2026-06-13 line numbering). Reconciled 2026-07-01.
- [ ] **4. geometry / geography types** — HALF DONE (reconciled 2026-07-01): `unknown` landed ✅
      2026-06-17 (interop-proven); geometry/geography remain ❌ and are DEMOTED to opportunistic
      by the 2026-06-21 engine-first re-anchor (a query engine does not pull them).
- [x] **5. `RewritePositionDeleteFiles` + the `ActionsProvider` maintenance wrappers** — DONE
      2026-06-17 (✅ per the Maintenance rows; `DeleteReachableFiles` + `ConvertEqualityDeleteFiles`
      interop-proven). Reconciled 2026-07-01.
- [x] **6. `BatchScan` / `ScanTaskGroup` + `ExpressionParser` JSON** — DONE 2026-06-17 (all
      three ✅, interop-proven: `BatchScan`, `planTasks` split planning, the JSON expression
      (de)serializer). Reconciled 2026-07-01.
- [ ] **7. [PARKED] encryption** — reconciled 2026-07-01: the Glue / S3Tables VIEWS half is
      RESOLVED as parity-correct-unsupported (rows R126/R127, verified 2026-06-17 — NOT owed);
      encryption remains ❌ and is DEMOTED to opportunistic by the engine-first re-anchor. The
      credentialed real-catalog hardening piece moved to the 2026-07-01 queue (item 6).

Recently landed (2026-06-11 → 06-13) — status lives in the GAP_MATRIX rows; pointers only:

- Write-action DATA-level interop (delete/overwrite/replace/rewrite + partitioned + merge one-bin /
  multi-bin), both directions — `interop_write_data.rs` + `run-interop-write-data.sh`. Rows 90-95.
- `case_sensitive(bool)` on DeleteFiles/OverwriteFiles/RowDelta (default true; narrowed out of
  ReplacePartitions) — row 134. Interop deferred.
- `DeleteFiles.delete_from_row_filter(Predicate)` — row 135. Interop deferred.
- `RewriteFiles` DELETE-file ADD surface (`add_delete_file` / `_with_sequence_number` + 4-arg
  `rewrite_files_with_deletes`, third precondition reachable) — rows 95/140. Interop deferred.

See the 2026-06-13 GAP_MATRIX provenance block for per-row status and residue.

## CHARTER (2026-06-15, Opus): conflict-validation + multi-spec interop — AC·OO groups

User-approved 8h charter (2026-06-15). Close the "conflict-validation paths NOT covered" residue on
the write-action rows (C1 OverwriteFiles ✅ #64), then multi-spec. EVERY sequence is one **AC·OO
group** = a coherent PR-unit run as **Opus Actor → Opus Critic** (the user lifted the single-agent
default + named the tier). **One PR per group**; rebase on freshly-merged `main` between groups. The
C1 increment (`interop_overwrite_conflict.rs` + `OverwriteConflictOracle` + `run-interop-overwrite-conflict.sh`)
is the harness template; per-group loop = Actor builds + drives the LIVE oracle to green + offline
gate → Critic adversarially re-verifies (sabotage truly fails, D1/D2 independence, claim-vs-Java-1.10.0,
done-bar = unit + interop both directions, de-triplication, no over-scope) → finalize + PR.

Wave 1 — conflict-validation closeout (order locked):

- [x] **AC·OO #1 — C4 ReplacePartitions** (row 92) — **DONE 2026-06-15.** Partition-scoped conflict
      (`file_in_replaced_partition`, no filter); 2 scenarios (replaced-partition→REJECT, other→ACCEPT)
      both directions + fail-closed sabotage. Opus Actor → Opus Critic converged (2 cycles; cycle-1
      caught a masked-sabotage defect, fixed + independently re-verified). Files: `interop_replace_partitions_conflict.rs`,
      `run-interop-replace-partitions-conflict.sh`, `ReplacePartitionsConflictOracle`. Row 92 stays 🟡.
- [x] **AC·OO #2 — C3 RowDelta** (row 94) — **DONE 2026-06-15.** All THREE axes proven both directions:
      `validate_no_conflicting_data_files` (filter/metrics, C1 shape) + `_delete_files` (concurrent
      y-keyed eq-delete add) + `validate_data_files_exist` (concurrent OVERWRITE removal). 6 scenarios
      (reject+accept per axis). Opus Actor → Opus Critic converged in 1 cycle; Critic disabled each
      axis's validation in turn to prove per-axis non-vacuity. Files: `interop_rowdelta_conflict.rs`,
      `run-interop-rowdelta-conflict.sh`, `RowDeltaConflictOracle`. Row 94 stays 🟡.
- [x] **AC·OO #3 — C2 DeleteFiles** (row 93) — **DONE 2026-06-16.** Single `validate_files_exist`
      axis; 2 scenarios (same-file→REJECT, different-file→ACCEPT) both directions + sabotage
      (semantic-rollback + truncate). **Critic caught a MEDIUM** (D1 vacuous on the axis) but
      wrongly marked CONVERGED; orchestrator caught the contradiction. The Critic's fix (assert the
      reject message) proved FLAKY on my mutation test — Rust has TWO racing reject paths for a
      removed target (the `validate_files_exist` axis vs an UNCONDITIONAL by-path `process_deletes`
      check). Resolved HONESTLY: D2 isolates the axis (strip Java's flag → ACCEPT; Java gates the
      check on the flag, Rust's by-path is unconditional — a documented mechanism divergence), D1
      corroborates the DECISION, the axis is pinned by `delete_files.rs` unit tests. Row 93 stays 🟡.
      Files: `interop_deletefiles_conflict.rs`, `run-interop-deletefiles-conflict.sh`, `DeleteFilesConflictOracle`.
- [x] **AC·OO #4 — C5 RewriteFiles** (row 95) — **DONE 2026-06-16.** `validate_no_new_deletes_for_data_files`,
      the seq-preservation + position-vs-equality nuance: 4 scenarios both directions —
      no-seq+eq→REJECT, seq+eq→ACCEPT (ignored), seq+position→REJECT (always fatal), disjoint→ACCEPT.
      Actor engineered AROUND the C2 trap (A live at S0 AND S1, so only the axis can reject; confirmed
      by axis-message assertion + 2 mutation-swaps). Hardened loop; Critic source-disabled the
      validation to prove non-vacuity → converged 1 cycle, NO_FINDINGS. Files:
      `interop_rewritefiles_conflict.rs`, `run-interop-rewritefiles-conflict.sh`, `RewriteFilesConflictOracle`.
      Row 95 stays 🟡. **Wave 1 COMPLETE — all 5 write-action conflict rows interop-proven.**

Wave 2 — multi-spec write interop (stretch):

- [x] **AC·OO #5 — MS** — **DONE 2026-06-16.** RowDelta multi-spec DELETE commit: one `row_delta`
      adding position deletes under spec 0 AND spec 1 → TWO per-spec DELETE manifests, canonical view
      byte-matches Java 1.10.0 (3 directions + 4 sabotages incl. SB4 wrong-spec rendering). Closes the
      "multi-spec delete commits" residue on row 94. Converged 1 cycle, NO_FINDINGS; Critic wrote its
      own collapse probe to confirm `grouping_is_load_bearing`. Files: `interop_multispec_merge.rs`,
      `run-interop-multispec-merge.sh`, `MultiSpecMergeOracle`.
      **⚠ NEW PARITY FINDING (follow-on, surfaced by the Actor):** on the MERGING path Java
      force-merges every spec group NOT containing the iterator-`first` manifest (order-dependent,
      ignores min-count-to-merge) — Rust's merging producer does NOT mirror this. Documented in row 94.
      The multi-spec DATA cases (overwrite/rewrite carrying old-spec + adding new-spec) are deferred
      behind this asymmetry. **→ tracked as new queue item below.**
      **⚠ RE-CHARACTERIZED 2026-06-16 (post-review, code-verified): the framing above is IMPRECISE —
      `merge_append.rs` DOES port the force-merge faithfully; the real gap is that the NON-APPEND actions
      route through `DefaultManifestProcess` (no merge). See the corrected follow-on item below + the
      re-characterized GAP_MATRIX row 94.**

Wave 3 — builder-surface flips (stretch, only if 1+2 beat estimates):

- [x] **AC·OO #6 — BF** — **DONE 2026-06-16 (#TBD).** DeleteFiles 2-for-1 vehicle
      (`delete_from_row_filter` + `case_sensitive`) proven bidirectionally vs Java 1.10.0: 5 scenarios
      (filter DELETE / KEEP-complement / PARTIAL-error + case-insensitive-match + case-sensitive-reject),
      live oracle GREEN (D1 + D2 + semantic-rename & truncate sabotages, exit 0). **Row 135
      (`deleteFromRowFilter`) → ✅** — the FIRST ✅ flip since Wave 1 began (2 named fail-safe
      divergences: `markedForDelete` short-circuit + empty-match no-op, both Rust-stricter, kept out of
      the set). **Row 134 stays 🟡** — its `caseSensitive` SLICE is now ✅ interop-proven (shared
      `bind(schema, case_sensitive)` site; the conflict-filter family argued-equivalent via the same bind
      call + 25 unit tests + C1/C3 interop), but the row's conflict-detection surfaces
      (`validateNoConflictingData`/`conflictDetectionFilter`, ReplacePartitions `conflict_detection_filter`,
      `validateAppendOnly`) remain unported. Converged 1 cycle; Critic CONVERGED (both non-vacuity gates
      mutation-proven; orchestrator re-ran the live oracle + offline gate + fixed 2 LOW nits). Files:
      `interop_builder_flips.rs`, `run-interop-builder-flips.sh`, `BuilderFlipsOracle`.
      **Wave 3 COMPLETE — the 8h AC·OO charter (Waves 1 + 2 + 3) is fully landed.**

## POST-CHARTER (2026-06-16, Opus) — maintenance/actions surface (AC·OO continues)

Stance-review-ranked next surface (ActionsProvider + the cheap maintenance wrappers — orchestrate ✅
primitives). AC·OO via Workflow, one PR per unit, same finalize cadence. Track A (multi-spec MERGING-path
wiring gap) DEPRIORITIZED: recon confirmed `min-count-to-merge` default = 100, so the divergence is
dormant for realistic single commits (narrow non-`first` ≥2-manifest sub-case only).

- [x] **PC #1 — RemoveDanglingDeleteFiles → ✅** — **DONE 2026-06-16 (#TBD).** Interop-only (the action +
      22 tests already existed; only interop was deferred). Converged 2 cycles (cycle-1 LOW: the position
      at-exact-min boundary was unit-pinned only → cycle-2 restructured `pk` to a TRUE at-exact-min position
      delete via data+pos-del in one `row_delta`, so BOTH off-by-one boundaries are now interop-pinned).
      Proves 3 anti-circular engine-agnostic claims (Java's actual action is Spark-surface, N/A): semantics
      match Java's independent `findDanglingDeletes`, API-contract counters/survivors, and CORRUPTION-SAFETY
      read-identity (MoR live-id set identical before↔after, both directions). DV-REMOVE is now a real e2e
      Puffin-DV fixture (closed the prior pure-fn-only gap). Live oracle GREEN (D1+D2+3 sabotages, exit 0);
      all 6 non-vacuity gates mutation-proven by the Critic. **GAP_MATRIX row 135 🟡→✅.** Two infra crashes
      first (529 overload) — hardened the workflow loop with null-guards (see [[parity-next-work]]). Files:
      `interop_remove_dangling.rs`, `run-interop-remove-dangling.sh`, `RemoveDanglingOracle`.
- [x] **PC #2 — ActionsProvider** — **DONE 2026-06-16 (#TBD).** Rust `ActionsProvider` trait (12
      snake_case methods mirroring Java `api/actions/ActionsProvider` 1.10.0, javap-confirmed) + a concrete
      `Actions` factory (`Actions::get`) overriding the 6 built actions (delete_orphan_files,
      rewrite_data_files, compute_table_stats, remove_dangling_delete_files via `X::new(table)`;
      expire_snapshots, rewrite_manifests via the transaction seam — required re-exporting the 2 seam types).
      Unbuilt actions return `Result<NoAction>` over an UNINHABITED empty enum (Ok arm statically
      unreachable ⇒ no stub can masquerade as real) → typed `FeatureUnsupported`. ORACLE-INDEPENDENT
      (factory has no byte-level round-trip; offline gate IS the verification). Converged 1 cycle; Critic
      javap-confirmed parity + mutation-tested the wiring (breaking a factory method fails 2 tests incl. a
      live MemoryCatalog execute smoke test). **GAP_MATRIX row 151 ❌→🟡** (partial). Underlying actions
      UNCHANGED. Files: `maintenance/actions_provider.rs` + 2 mod re-exports.
- [x] **PC #3 — DeleteReachableFiles** — **DONE 2026-06-16 (#TBD).** The DROP-TABLE-PURGE engine:
      `DeleteReachableFiles::new(metadata_location: &str)` (Java String arg shape) collects the FULL
      reachable set across ALL snapshots — categorized into the 6 javap-verified Java `Result` buckets
      (manifest lists, manifests, data, position-deletes [DVs fold here by content-type], equality-deletes,
      + current/all-previous metadata.json + version-hint + statistics + partition-statistics) — and deletes
      each via FileIO. Reuses the `DeleteOrphanFiles::collect_valid_files` walk shape WITHOUT changing it
      (separate categorizing collector). Interop-proven both directions against Java's ENGINE-AGNOSTIC
      `ReachableFileUtil` (clean non-circular oracle): Rust reachable set == Java's, + delete-completeness
      (no orphan-leak/under-delete, no data-loss/over-delete) + under-count sabotage. **Wired into
      ActionsProvider** (`delete_reachable_files` FeatureUnsupported→real; factory now 7 supported / 5
      unsupported). Converged 1 cycle; all 6 non-vacuity gates mutation-proven (each reachable category +
      all-snapshots + the deletion + the provider override). `DeleteOrphanFiles` + Cargo UNCHANGED.
      **GAP_MATRIX row 151 stays 🟡** (DeleteReachableFiles portion now ✅+interop). Files:
      `delete_reachable_files.rs`, `interop_delete_reachable.rs`, `run-interop-delete-reachable.sh`,

Grounded by a 9-unit parallel scoping pass (each scoped vs the live code + 1.10.0 jars). Front-load the
three low-risk OFFLINE-gated wins (near-zero 529 exposure), then the one hard capstone. Each is
independent → its own PR; run strictly one-at-a-time (rebase on freshly-merged main between groups).
Expected outcome: 3 rows flip ✅ (144, 138, 151), ActionsProvider 7/5→8/4, eq→pos capability lands;
parity ~25→28 ✅.

- [x] **G1 — `ReplacePartitions.validateAppendOnly()`** — **DONE 2026-06-16 (#TBD).** **row 144 🟡→✅.**
      One bool + builder on `ReplacePartitionsAction`; guard = `!resolved.is_empty()` on the existing
      `resolve_partition_deletes` result (snapshot.rs:703). Critic javap-verified + CORRECTED the wrong
      residue: `conflictDetectionFilter` is NOT in Java 1.10.0 on DeleteFiles/ReplacePartitions (void),
      `validateAppendOnly` is ReplacePartitions-only — built ONLY that, no anti-parity surface. 4 unit
      tests + mutation-proven guard (disabling it fails the 2 reject tests). Converged 1 cycle, offline
      gate green. Files: `replace_partitions.rs`, `transaction/map.md`, GAP_MATRIX row 144.
      **CRITICAL: build ONLY validateAppendOnly** — javap proves `conflictDetectionFilter` on
      DeleteFiles/ReplacePartitions does NOT exist in Java 1.10.0; the row-144 residue list is factually
      wrong — ALSO correct the row text (the 2 void items + this 1 real port ⇒ row flips ✅).
- [x] **G2 — `ComputePartitionStats` action + `UpdatePartitionStatistics` commit seam** — **DONE
      2026-06-17 (#TBD).** **row 138 🟡→✅**; ActionsProvider `compute_partition_stats`
      FeatureUnsupported→real (**8/4**). New `transaction/update_partition_statistics.rs` seam (clone of
      `UpdateStatisticsAction` over `PartitionStatisticsFile`, emits Set/RemovePartitionStatistics +
      UuidMatch) + `maintenance/compute_partition_stats.rs` action (clone of `ComputeTableStats`). Snags
      resolved: register_partition_stats_file REWRITTEN to delegate through the new seam (ONE commit path,
      no duplicate); Ok(None)→typed DataInvalid; UuidMatch attached. Converged 1 cycle; Critic
      mutation-proved 3 wirings + confirmed the delegated commit is byte-identical to the proven path.
      Orchestrator RE-RAN `run-interop-partition-stats.sh` GREEN (both chains) to confirm the refactor
      preserved the Z3/R2/R3-proven bytes. Offline gate green (2314 lib). Files: `update_partition_statistics.rs`,
      `compute_partition_stats.rs`, + seam/mod/provider/partition_stats wiring.
- [x] **G3 — `SupportsNamespaces` partial property set/remove** — **DONE 2026-06-17 (#TBD).**
      SupportsNamespaces component ✅ (row 151 STAYS 🟡 until G4). 3 default `Catalog` methods:
      `update_namespace_properties` (overlap-reject DataInvalid → get → clone → remove → extend →
      full-replace `update_namespace`) + `set`/`remove_namespace_properties` wrappers (1:1 with Java's two
      public methods; Result<()> not bool). 6 memory tests; 2 mutations proven (drop-remove, drop-overlap).
      **SQL fallback (good judgment):** the "preferred 1-line SQL delete-absent-keys fix" proved UNSAFE —
      the SQL catalog uses an `exists=true` SENTINEL property row as its namespace-existence anchor, so
      deleting absent keys makes namespaces VANISH (broke 2 pre-existing SQL tests). Reverted; documented
      the divergence in-code + GAP_MATRIX; confined tests to the memory catalog (faithful full-replace).
      SQL diff is comment-only (behavior unchanged; 68 SQL tests green). Converged 1 cycle, no findings.
      Files: `catalog/mod.rs`, `catalog/memory/catalog.rs`, `catalog/sql/catalog.rs` (NOTE only), GAP_MATRIX row 151.
- [x] **G4 — `ConvertEqualityDeleteFiles`** — **DONE 2026-06-17 (#TBD). COMPLETES row 151 🟡→✅.** The
      capstone: NEW eq→pos write logic, 1:1 port of Java `api/actions/ConvertEqualityDeleteFiles` (free-standing,
      not a provider method). Per eq-delete: build the survival predicate → applicable LIVE data files
      (strictly-lower data-seq, same partition / global) → read with ABSOLUTE `_pos` → collect MATCHING
      positions → sort → write pos-deletes stamped with the eq-delete's data-seq → RewriteFiles 4-set replace.
      All FOUR corruption-stallers (absolute-pos, seq-stamp, applicability, matching-not-surviving)
      mutation-proven by the Critic (each breaks read-identity). 9 offline read-identity tests + no-Spark
      Java-MoR interop GREEN (live ids identical before-eq/after-pos). Converged 1 cycle. Read-path files
      touched VISIBILITY-ONLY (`parse_equality_deletes_record_batch_stream`/`try_cast_literal` → pub(crate);
      full 2329 lib suite green = no regression). Orchestrator re-ran the interop oracle (GREEN) + full lib.
      Files: `convert_equality_delete_files.rs` (+tests), `interop_convert_eq_delete.rs`, `run-interop-convert-eq-delete.sh`.

## BLOCK 2 (8-HOUR PLAN, 2026-06-17, Opus, signed off) — 3 sequential AC·OO PRs

Grounded by an 8-unit parallel scoping pass (vs main #78 + 1.10.0 jars). Highest ✅-flip density yet: 4
rows. All med-risk with strong reuse/templating (no HIGH capstone). Each independent → own PR, run
one-at-a-time. Expected: rows 134/89/120/121 → ✅, ActionsProvider 9/12, parity ~28→32 ✅.
(Pruned by scoping: AggregateEvaluator's BoundExtract = frontier-parked variant-shredding → only 🟡;
SnapshotTable/MigrateTable need an external-table source → stay ❌; both deferred.)

- [x] **G1 — `RewritePositionDeleteFiles`** — **DONE 2026-06-17 (#TBD). row 134 ❌→✅; provider 9/3.**
      V2 parquet pos-delete compaction (V3 DV/Puffin OUT, documented), a strict subset of
      `convert_equality_delete_files`. NEW parquet-pos-delete reader by RESERVED FIELD ID (2147483546/2147483545).
      Seq-stamp = group MAX rewritten data-seq via `add_delete_file_with_sequence_number` — mutation-proven 3
      ways (max→min, explicit→inherit both caught by an exact on-disk-seq assertion). 10 offline read-identity
      tests + no-Spark Java interop GREEN (Java MoR identical {100,130,200,230} before 4 pos-deletes/after 2
      compacted; sabotage battery HARD-FAILs). Converged 1 cycle, NO findings; Critic ran all 8
      non-vacuity/staller mutations itself. `rewrite_position_deletes` flipped FeatureUnsupported→real (provider
      8/4→9/3, mandatory — it IS a Java provider method). Orchestrator re-ran interop GREEN + full lib (2340).
      Files: `rewrite_position_delete_files.rs`(+tests), `interop_rewrite_pos_deletes.rs`, `run-interop-rewrite-pos-deletes.sh`.
      _Superseded plan note:_ near-complete blueprint = `convert_equality_delete_files.rs`. Front-loaded
      (highest reuse → highest convergence confidence).
- [x] **G2 — `unknown` V3 primitive type** — **DONE 2026-06-17 (#TBD). row 89 ❌→✅.** `PrimitiveType::Unknown`
      arm (Java-faithful PRIMITIVE, not a top-level Type; serde "unknown" free) + the V3 `min_format_version`
      gate (mutation-proven: removing it reds 3 V2-reject tests) + 9 compiler-forced arms (arrow→Null,
      avro→null, datum/glue/hms/inspect/partition_stats reject-loud). DEFERRED-LOUD: data-file always-null
      I/O (FeatureUnsupported, no silent wrong bytes). **Legality doors matched Java 1.10.0 bytecode EXACTLY
      (Critic-confirmed) — NOT mirror-Variant: `identity(unknown)` is ACCEPTED as a partition source (Java
      `Identity.UNSUPPORTED_TYPES` excludes UNKNOWN), value-producing transforms reject, identifier accepts.**
      Atomic full-workspace compile (iceberg+glue+hms); 2351 lib + 2 interop + 15 glue + 15 hms green.
      Metadata-only interop GREEN both directions (Java writes V3 unknown schema → Rust reads+writes → Java
      verifies; caught+fixed a field-id-reindex bug). Committed Java fixtures under testdata/interop/unknown_type/.
      Converged 1 cycle, NO findings. Files: `datatypes.rs` + 8 arm sites + `interop_unknown.rs` + `run-interop-unknown.sh`.
- [x] **G3 — `IncrementalAppendScan` + `IncrementalChangelogScan` interop** — **DONE 2026-06-17 (#TBD).
      rows 120 + 121 🟡→✅** (TWO rows). Interop-only (scans built; scan/incremental.rs UNCHANGED). 4-snapshot
      fixture (S1-3 appends + S4 overwrite), compared by data-file BASENAME (anti-circular). Append: 3 ranges
      (excl {b,c} / incl {a,b,c} / to-current {c}) — the incl/excl boundary pinned (a.parquet the only diff).
      Changelog: data-file-level {+b,+c,−a,+d} vs Java IncrementalDataTableScan. Both proven D1+D2 vs Java's
      REAL scans. Off-by-one boundary sabotage fails closed; PRODUCTION-level non-vacuity (mutating the
      inclusive→parent resolution at incremental.rs:256 reds the D1 test). Row 121 ✅ for the DATA-FILE
      changelog with row-level/CDC + BatchScan residue NAMED (matches Java current; not over-claimed).
      Converged 1 cycle, NO findings. Files: `interop_incremental_scans.rs`, `run-interop-incremental-scans.sh`, `IncrementalScanOracle`.

## BLOCK 3 (8-HOUR PLAN, 2026-06-17, Opus, signed off — the SPINE) — 3 sequential AC·OO PRs

Grounded by an 8-unit parallel scoping pass (vs main #81). **The easy ✅ flips are spent** — block 3 trades
✅-density for capability-advancement: only ExpressionParser is a clean ❌→✅ in one unit; the rest are
❌→🟡 advances or matrix corrections. Each independent → own PR, run one-at-a-time. Expected: 1 ✅ (147) +
2 ❌→🟡 (148, 149) + matrix corrections; parity 32→33✅, ❌ 14→12. Front-loaded with the marquee ✅; only
G1 is oracle-dependent.

- [x] **G1 — `ExpressionParser` JSON (toJson/fromJson)** — **DONE 2026-06-17 (#TBD). row 147 ❌→✅** + retired
      the ScanReport `filter` divergence (row 123 annotated, stays 🟡). Canonical codec over `Predicate`
      (`expr/expression_parser.rs`): byte-exact wire shape + op hyphen-map + SingleValueParser value forms;
      schema-aware `from_json(_, &Schema)` recovers the typed Datum (the typed-vs-untyped staller — handled);
      transform/aggregate terms rejected; depth-limited read recursion; wired into ScanReport.filter via custom
      serde. Converged 2 cycles (cycle-1 MEDIUM = float/double byte-parity → cycle-2 ported Java
      `Float/Double.toString` formatting, byte-confirmed vs the jar). Live interop D1+D2 byte-exact over 34
      expressions (0 failures) + 4-sabotage battery fails closed; Critic ran 4 source mutations (op-map,
      date-codec, float-E, binary-hex). **NAMED RESIDUE (honest, documented in row 147 + pinned by a unit
      test):** JDK-11 `FloatingDecimal` non-minimal floats (~0.33% large-magnitude) — Rust emits the minimal
      form (== JDK 19+), diverging only from the JDK-11 oracle; non-finite floats rejected. 2 LOW findings
      ACCEPTED-as-is (write-side depth limit — input already bounded by the read-side cap; signed-zero
      round-trip test gap — write preserves it). Files: `expression_parser.rs`, `interop_expression.rs`, `run-interop-expression.sh`.
- [x] **G2 — `AggregateEvaluator` (count/min/max pushdown)** — **DONE 2026-06-17 (#TBD). row 148 ❌→🟡.**
      UnboundAggregate{count_star/count/min/max}→bind→BoundAggregate + AggregateEvaluator folding from manifest
      DataFile metrics, NO scan. Critic DECOMPILED Java 1.10.0 bytecode (AggregateEvaluator/NullSafeAggregator/
      CountStar/CountNonNull/Min/MaxAggregate) — formulas match EXACTLY: count(*)=Σrecord_count,
      count(col)=Σ(value_count−null_count) [corrected from the plan's record_count−null], min/max via typed
      `Datum::partial_cmp`, the has_value AND/OR predicates + allNull short-circuit. STALLER mutation-proven:
      dropping the latched `is_valid=false` invalidation fails 5 cant-push tests (missing metric ⇒ not-pushable,
      never a silently-wrong partial). Bound/UnboundExtract CUT (the aggregate term is `Option<Reference>` — no
      extract type to construct; zero `*Extract` defs). 17 unit tests; full lib 2392. Converged 1 cycle. 2 LOW
      accepted (min/max NaN-ordering + partial_cmp→None=DataInvalid conservative — part of the 🟡 residue,
      addressed at the later interop ✅). Offline (529-light). Files: `expr/visitors/aggregate_evaluator.rs`.
- [x] **G3 — Catalog accessors + the Glue/S3Tables-views matrix correction** — **DONE 2026-06-17 (#TBD).
      row 149 ❌→🟡.** Four non-breaking DEFAULT `Catalog` methods (name/properties/invalidate_table/
      invalidate_view), overridden per impl from held config (REST/Glue/HMS/S3Tables/SQL) + the MemoryCatalog
      retain-name+props fix; `commitTransaction(List)` split out (deferred). `properties()` honestly disclaimed
      as a Rust-convenience (not a Java Catalog-interface method). Matrix correction: rewrote rows 124(a)/125
      (Glue/S3Tables view-unsupported = parity-correct — S3Tables SDK-verified zero view ops; Glue via #12488
      + Rust no-override) + annotated row 126 SessionCatalog assessed-deferred (dead surface). Converged 1
      cycle; Critic javap-confirmed parity + matrix accuracy + ran accessor mutations. Offline gate green
      (iceberg 2399 + glue 18 + hms 15 + rest 55 + s3tables 23 + sql 71). 2 LOW doc-accuracy nits the Critic
      caught (#12488 is OPEN not closed; properties() also on SessionCatalog) — FIXED by orchestrator before
      commit. HMS accessor compile-only (socket-resolving new()). Files: `catalog/mod.rs` + 6 impl files.

## ROADMAP CHECK (2026-06-17, Opus) — audit + 1 integrity fill-in

A verify-driven workflow audited Roadmap/GAP_MATRIX/live-code alignment + adversarially mutation-tested
the recent ✅ flips. **Verdict: on track.** Matrix accurate (~33✅/24🟡/11❌, pipe-clean); ActionsProvider
genuinely 9/3 in code; **6 of 7 recent greens (134/89/147/120-121/151/138) held under hostile
mutation-testing.** One crack found + fixed:

- [x] **VAO — `ReplacePartitions.validateAppendOnly` interop** — **DONE 2026-06-17.** The skeptic refuted
      row 144's ✅: `validateAppendOnly` had flipped on unit tests ALONE (#75), no interop — and unlike our
      no-Spark-oracle cases it has a real engine-agnostic Java oracle (core-API, not Spark). Built the
      missing bidirectional interop (`ValidateAppendOnlyOracle` + `run-interop-validate-append-only.sh` +
      `interop_validate_append_only.rs`): 4-case behavior-equivalence battery, Rust REJECTS exactly where
      Java THROWS `DeleteException`, COMMITS exactly where Java commits; `javap -c` re-decode confirmed the
      Rust guard already matches Java — **NO Rust fix needed.** AC·OO converged 1 cycle, Critic refutation
      FAILED (guard-neuter reds 2 unit tests + the mirror). Row 144 ✅ now meets the unit-tests-AND-interop
      bar. _Orchestrator re-ran the oracle (D1 4/4, D2 1-pass, sabotage fail-closed) + offline gate._

- [x] **Doc-drift correction PR** — **DONE 2026-06-17 (#86).** Resynced 16 Roadmap under-claims (stale ❌
      for RewritePositionDeleteFiles/ComputePartitionStats/Catalog-accessors/validateAppendOnly/unknown;
      "5/8 actions"→9/12; incremental scans interop-deferred→✅) + 3 GAP_MATRIX nits (row 105 xref 140→150;
      row 145 xref 134→144; row 138 stale 8/4→9/3 dropped per one-home). Docs-only, no glyph changed. _VAO
      interop merged #85._

## BLOCK 4 (8-HOUR PLAN, 2026-06-17, Opus, signed off) — BatchScan: 2 sequential AC·OO PRs

Grounded by a 3-agent scoping pass (Java javap contract + live Rust scan module + matrix rows 122/146).
**Decisive finding:** in Java 1.10.0 `Table.newBatchScan()` is a thin `BatchScanAdapter` delegating
`planTasks()`/`planFiles()` 1:1 to `BaseTableScan` — so porting `planTasks()` IS porting BatchScan; rows
122 + 146 are ONE gap, 146 subsumes 122. `planTasks()` = `splitFiles(planFiles(), target)` →
bin-pack(`largestBinFirst=true`). Props: `read.split.target-size`(128MiB)/`planning-lookback`(10)/
`open-file-cost`(4MiB). DataFusion uses `to_arrow()` not tasks → no forced ripple. Statuses live ONLY in
[GAP_MATRIX](../docs/parity/GAP_MATRIX.md).

- [x] **U1 — `plan_tasks()` + planning structures + Java oracle → row 146 ❌→🟡** — **DONE 2026-06-17.**
      AC·OO converged 1 cycle, Critic refutation FAILED (mutation-tested largestBinFirst/weight-floor/offsets-split
      → reds the right tests). Landed `scan/task_group.rs` + `scan/bin_pack.rs` + `FileScanTask::split` + flagged
      `split_offsets` field (benign `split_offsets:None` ripple into arrow/* + rewrite_data_files test literals) +
      `TableScan::plan_tasks()` ABOVE an unchanged `plan_files()`. 30 offline tests + bidirectional `ScanPlanOracle`
      (D1 11 groups / D2 16 groups / sabotage 11→1 + 8→2). **HONEST FLIP: 146 ❌→🟡 not ✅** — 146 *subsumes* the
      typed `BatchScan` surface (row 122, still ❌ until U2), so the core planTasks/split/bin-pack is interop-proven
      but the row is not fully ✅ yet. Orchestrator fixed 1 LOW (stale off-by-one sabotage comment → large-target),
      re-ran the oracle + offline gate, verified the arrow ripple is field-default-only + Cargo untouched.
      `DataTask` = metadata-tables (separate surface, deferred). _Original plan said ❌→✅; corrected to ❌→🟡 for the
      subsumption-honesty reason above._
  _Delivered spec (reference):_ `ScanTaskGroup`/`CombinedScanTask` + `SplittableScanTask::split(target)` (offsets-aware: one
      sub-task per strictly-ascending split-offset, target ignored; else fixed-size `min(target,remaining)`;
      non-splittable→no split; sub-tasks clone deletes/residual/partition) + `BinPacking` port (largestBinFirst
      eviction; weight `max(len+deleteBytes, (1+#deletes)·openFileCost)`). `TableScan::plan_tasks()` sits ABOVE
      `plan_files()` (preserve its byte-unchanged/no-reporter invariant); builder knobs w/ Java defaults+override;
      thread `split_offsets` from manifest entry into `FileScanTask` (flagged additive public field). **Interop
      (real bidirectional, NOT no-Spark):** `ScanPlanOracle` drives `newScan().planTasks()` over a fixture
      exercising fixed-size+bin-pack (+offsets-aware +MoR-delete-weight); compare multiset of per-group
      `{(path,start,length)}` sets + group count, both directions; anti-circular target/lookback/cost; fail-closed
      sabotage (±1B target re-pack; drop split-offset). RISK: MoR (every sub-task keeps same path+pos deletes),
      offset fidelity, i64/u64 no-`as`, the plan_files invariant.
- [x] **U2 — typed `BatchScan` scan-kind → rows 122 ❌→✅ AND 146 🟡→✅** — **DONE 2026-06-17.** AC·OO
      converged 1 cycle, Critic refutation FAILED (mutation-tested `as_of_time` `<=` and the delegation →
      reds the right tests; re-decoded `BatchScanAdapter`/`SnapshotUtil.snapshotIdAsOfTime` via javap).
      `scan/batch.rs` (`Table::batch_scan()`) — thin `BatchScanAdapter`-shaped adapter delegating
      `plan_files`/`plan_tasks` to the U1 `TableScan` pipeline (REUSED, not forked) + `use_snapshot`/`use_ref`/
      `as_of_time` selectors (greatest `timestamp_ms <= ms`, first-wins conflict). 11 offline tests + 2
      mutation-baits. Oracle EXTENDED to drive `table.newBatchScan().planTasks()` == `newScan().planTasks()`
      (Java adapter delegation) == Rust, both directions (D1 11 / D2 16, 0 failures). Orchestrator fixed 1 LOW
      (matrix `core/`→`api/BatchScanAdapter`), left 1 LOW cosmetic (conflict-msg id not embedded for
      as_of_time/ref — behavior/kind/tests unaffected), re-ran the oracle + offline gate (125 scan + 2440 lib,
      U1 unregressed), Cargo/datafusion untouched.

Sequencing (done): U1 (146 ❌→🟡) → merge #87 → rebase → U2 (146 🟡→✅ + 122 ❌→✅). Both interop-proven.
Parity after block 4: **34✅, ❌ 9** (U1: ❌ 11→10 via 146→🟡; U2: 122 ❌→✅ + 146 🟡→✅).

## BLOCK 5 (RewriteTablePath, 2026-06-17, Opus, signed off) — 1 AC·OO PR

Grounded by a 3-agent scoping pass. **Key finding: `org.apache.iceberg.RewriteTablePathUtil` is engine-agnostic

## BLOCK 6 (Avro data-file READ, 2026-06-18, Opus, signed off) — 2 sequential AC·OO PRs

Grounded by a 3-agent scoping pass. **Row 117 is ❌ on the live matrix** (the memory's "🟡" was WRONG — zero Avro
data code; `avro/` is manifest-schema only). Java data path = `PlannedDataReader` (id-based partner-visitor read
plan: id→pos in FILE order, null pos → skip, missing ids → constant/initial-default/IS_DELETED=false/ROW_POSITION/
optional=null/else error; read-time int→long & float→double promotion; logical types date=int-days/time+ts(tz)-micros=
long/ts(tz)-nanos=long/decimal=BE-two's-complement+scale/uuid=fixed16/fixed[L]/binary=bytes; optional=union[null,T]).
**Reuse:** `avro/schema.rs` already converts Avro↔Iceberg by field-id; `apache_avro::Reader` is a row Iterator<Value>
(NO Cargo edit); `RecordBatchTransformer` + delete-filter are format-agnostic. **Missing:** an Avro-Value→Arrow-array
builder + a `FileFormat` dispatch (today `arrow/reader.rs::process_file_scan_task` is Parquet-ONLY — an Avro file
fails as a corrupt-Parquet-footer error). Statuses live ONLY in [GAP_MATRIX](../docs/parity/GAP_MATRIX.md).

- [x] **U1 — Avro-`Value`→Arrow reader CORE + offline goldens (no matrix flip; engine only)** — **DONE 2026-06-18.**
      AC·OO converged 3 cycles. **Cycle-1 Critic caught a HIGH** (nested structs resolved POSITIONALLY not by
      field-id — would break on any reordered/projected/defaulted nested struct); Actor rebuilt the read-plan
      RECURSIVELY (by-field-id at EVERY struct level) + added 4 nested-by-id tests (subset/reorder/skip-extra+missing-
      optional/list-of-struct/map-of-struct-value); cycles 2-3 cleared a V3-row-lineage MEDIUM down to named residue.
      `arrow/avro_reader.rs` (`read_avro_data_file`/`read_avro_data_bytes`) + `_tests.rs` (29 offline goldens) +
      `arrow/mod.rs`. 6-rung missing-default priority + int→long/float→double promotion + decimal-BE-two's-complement +
      uuid-fixed16 + all logical types, bytecode-verified. Critic mutation-tested decimal-sign-ext/projection-skip/
      missing-default → each reds. Orchestrator re-ran offline gate (29 module + 2484 lib, fmt, clippy), confirmed NO
      Cargo edit + NO scan-path edit (pure module) + matrix UNTOUCHED. **Reconciled:** `read_data_file_stream` is
      Parquet-only → the Avro reader is a justified disjoint path, not a parallel reader. **3 LOW (named):** timestamp
      tz-by-expected-type (parity-correct, re-prove at U2 interop); positional list/map element (parity-faithful);
      Enum-as-string liberality. **DEFERRED to U2/later:** name-mapping fallback, V3 row-lineage present-field readers,
      variant read. **Row 117 STAYS ❌** (engine not scan-wired — U2 flips it).
  _Delivered spec (reference):_ `apache_avro::Reader` datum stream → field-id read-plan (projection/skip/missing-defaults via `avro_schema_to_schema`)
      → Arrow `RecordBatch`es (via `schema_to_arrow_schema` + array builders). ALL primitives + logical types + nested
      struct/list/map + null/union + int→long/float→double promotion. Offline tests: checked-in GOLDEN Avro files +
      hand-declared expected rows + mutation baits. Pure module, no scan dependency. **RECONCILE with
      `convert_equality_delete_files.rs` `read_data_file_stream`** (scope flagged it may already touch the data-read
      path — do NOT build a parallel reader). Row 117 STAYS ❌ (engine not scan-wired yet — honest, like BatchScan U1).
- [x] **U2 — scan read-path wiring + interop → row 117 ❌→🟡** — **DONE 2026-06-18.** AC·OO converged 1 cycle,
      Critic refutation FAILED (mutation-tested dispatch-break → 5/6 Avro tests RED as corrupt-Parquet-footer, and
      delete-disable → 3 MoR tests RED). `process_file_scan_task` dispatches on `task.data_file_format`: Parquet body
      byte-UNCHANGED (moved verbatim into `process_parquet_file_scan_task`), Avro → U1 `read_avro_data_file` + the SAME
      `RecordBatchTransformer` + MoR deletes POST-materialization (positional via new `DeleteVector::contains`, equality+
      residual via a survival mask), **ORC errors CLEANLY** (fixes the latent silent wrong-format read, row 116). **De-forked** the
      field-id predicate evaluator into shared `arrow/record_batch_predicate.rs`, now used by BOTH the Avro path AND
      `ConvertEqualityDeleteFiles` (one impl). 6 scan tests + mutation baits. **Interop ✅ D1** (`AvroDataOracle`: Java
      `GenericAppenderFactory.newDataWriter(FileFormat.AVRO)` writes a V2 table, MoR pos-delete removes id=20; Rust scan →
      row-identity over every primitive+logical+optional/null; sabotage fail-closed exit 101). Orchestrator FULLY

## BLOCK 7 (Avro data-file WRITE, 2026-06-18, Opus, signed off) — 2 sequential AC·OO PRs → completes row 117 🟡→✅

Mirrors the U1/U2 read cadence. Deep-scope workflow decoded the Java 1.10.0 Avro write contract (DataWriter /
ValueWriters / GenericWriters / AvroSchemaUtil / AvroMetrics) from ~/.m2 jars and mapped it onto the writer seam.
The honest flip REQUIRES a real production writer (the row-117 residue literally names "there is NO Avro DataFileWriter"),
so a test-only encode would be an overclaim — W1 builds the engine, W2 proves it with Direction-2 interop + flips.

- [x] **W1 — production `AvroWriter` (engine; no matrix flip)** — **DONE 2026-06-18.** AC·OO converged cycle 2 (cycle 1
      CONVERGED with 2 MEDIUM test-strength findings; cycle 2 closed them). NEW `writer/file_writer/avro_writer.rs`
      (`AvroWriterBuilder`/`AvroWriter`) implementing the `FileWriterBuilder`/`FileWriter` RPITIT seam, mirroring
      `parquet_writer.rs`, slotting into `DataFileWriter`/`RollingFileWriter` with a 2-line `mod.rs` seam only. Encoder
      reuses the proven `arrow_struct_to_literal` → `RawLiteral` → `schema_to_avro_schema` path (field-ids stamped).
      **Metrics = record_count + file_size ONLY** (Java `AvroMetrics.fromWriter` = `Metrics(rowCount,null,null,null,null)`;
      all six column maps EMPTY — positively asserted, the false-parity mutation-bait). Codec default null, deflate
      supported; variant/unknown rejected (reader-symmetric); empty-input deletes file + returns vec![]. 11 module tests
      (all-types + nested + nested-optional U1 round-trips, raw-byte union/decimal-width pin, metrics-empty, via-DataFileWriter,
      empty, variant-reject, deflate, live-size). Critic re-decoded Java per-type encoding byte-faithful + mutation-tested
      all 5 traps (union-flip / decimal-width / populated-metric / dropped-field-id / tz-shift — each bit a test) + re-ran
      gate. **Orchestrator-verified:** renamed placeholder `AvroWriter1`→`AvroWriter` (inner `apache_avro::Writer` aliased
      `OcfWriter`) + explicit re-export; re-ran gate MYSELF — lib **2501** passed/0, clippy 0 warnings, fmt + typos clean;
      Cargo/lock/GAP_MATRIX untouched; ASF header present. **3 LOW (named, none in W1 new code):** `arrow/value.rs:59`
      required-child-under-null-parent (pre-existing shared reader converter — carry to W2/future); `current_written_size`
      uncompressed underestimate (sound roll signal, disclosed); `decimal_required_bytes` log10 `-1` nuance (pre-existing
      shared spec fn, no divergence in tested precisions). NO matrix flip (engine only).
- [x] **W2 — Direction-2 interop (row 117 STAYS 🟡 — tz-fix parked, user decision)** — **DONE 2026-06-18.** AC·OO
      converged 1 cycle (Critic CONVERGED, 3 LOW). Rust GEN test (`tests/interop_avro_write.rs`) writes
      `00000-rust-data.avro` THROUGH the W1 production writer; Java (`AvroWriteOracle` + `verify-interop-avro-write` +
      `run-interop-avro-write.sh`) reads the RAW file via `Avro.read(...).project(schema).createReaderFunc(PlannedDataReader::create)`
      and asserts row-identity vs TWO anchors (Java's OWN constants AND the Rust JSON — anti-circular, .avro the only crossing
      artifact, Rust never reads its own write). Flat fixture, no delete. Fail-closed sabotage (corrupt one decimal → anchor (b)
      diverges, anchor (a) still passes; HARD-FAIL never SKIP, scratch-copy restored). **Orchestrator-verified:** re-ran the live
      oracle MYSELF (RC=0, Java reads all 5 rows = both anchors, sabotage diverged) + offline gate (GEN no-op, lib 2501,
      clippy 0, fmt, typos); diff scoped to 4 files; Cargo untouched. **The oracle SURFACED a real divergence** → brought to
      the user, who chose **keep 🟡 + PARK the fix**: Rust's shared `avro/schema.rs::schema_to_avro_schema` maps both
      `timestamp` and `timestamptz` to Avro `timestamp-micros` WITHOUT `adjust-to-utc=true`, so Java reads a Rust `timestamptz`
      as `LocalDateTime` not `OffsetDateTime` (INSTANT value identical, tz-attribute does not round-trip → not yet 1:1). Named
      as THE 🟡-blocker in row 117; emitting `adjust-to-utc` is a separate on-disk-format unit deliberately not pursued. Census
      UNCHANGED **34✅/27🟡/7❌** (117 was already 🟡 from U2). Note: the strict `| ✅ |` grep UNDERCOUNTS (~7 status cells
      carry extra content) — the robust column-2 tally is 34✅/27🟡/7❌.

## BLOCK 8 (Type utilities `TypeUtil` completion, 2026-06-18, Opus, signed off) — 1 AC·OO PR → row 143 🟡→✅

SnapshotTable/MigrateTable (137) was SCOPED then TABLED — the actions are Spark-only (api interfaces + empty core markers; only iceberg-spark has impls); the engine-agnostic core is `TableMigrationUtil` (directory→DataFiles+metrics) which needs a non-Iceberg source-catalog reader (Hive Metastore) this library lacks, NOT a query engine. Row 137 can't reach ✅ regardless (MigrateTable = destructive in-place source replace). User pivoted to an actionable green flip.

- [x] **`TypeUtil` completion → row 143 🟡→✅** — **DONE 2026-06-18.** Ported the missing engine-agnostic `TypeUtil` fns
      (all pure, no deps, interop N/A) into `spec/schema/`: **assign-ids** (`assign_fresh_ids` level-order, now the SHARED
      engine consumed by `transaction/update_schema.rs` — its private copy DELETED; `assign_fresh_ids_with_base` name-reuse
      overload; `assign_increasing_fresh_ids`; `assign_ids`), **reassign** (`reassign_ids`/`_or_refresh` align-by-name,
      matched-name structural type-mismatch THROWS per Java `Preconditions.checkArgument`, `reassign_doc`,
      `refresh_identifier_fields`), **check-compat** (`compat.rs`: `validate_write_schema`/`validate_schema`/
      `check_schema_compatibility` porting `CheckCompatibility`), **projection** (`project`/`select`/`select_not`/
      `get_projected_ids` — the project-vs-select subtree distinction pinned), **peripherals** (`join`, `estimate_size`,
      `index_quoted_name_by_id`). 40+ unit tests; `CustomOrderSchemaVisitor` named-residue (every consumer ported as explicit
      recursion). **PROCESS NOTE — did NOT converge in 3 AC·OO cycles; orchestrator remediated.** The cycle-3 Critic (which
      ran LIVE Java 1.10.0) correctly REFUSED to converge: (1) **mustFix** — `check-compat` wiring was INVERTED
      (`write/typeCompatibilityErrors` swapped `checkOrdering`↔`checkNullability`; Java's `CheckCompatibility(schema,
      checkOrdering, checkNullability)` ctor + `if(checkNullability) writeCompat(.., checkOrdering)` — write/type differ ONLY
      in nullability, the passed bool is ALWAYS checkOrdering), and 2 tests pinned behavior Java never produces; (2) **HIGH**
      — `estimate_size` map arm was `12+5·(k+v)`, Java is `12+5·(12+k+v)` (map<int,string>=362 not 302); (3) **LOW** — a
      `base_id_for` comment misdiagnosed a borrow workaround as an "optimizer miscompile". **Orchestrator fix (verified each
      against the 1.10.0 bytecode MYSELF):** corrected the compat wiring (helpers take `check_ordering`, hardcode
      `check_nullability` true/false; `check_schema_compatibility` branches on `check_nullability`; `validate_write_schema`
      forwards correctly), fixed the 2 wrong tests to the live-Java truth table (assertions intact), fixed the map formula +
      added a map=362 test, removed the misdiagnosis comment, corrected the matrix narrative (formula + wiring). Re-ran gate
      MYSELF: lib **2544** passed/0, clippy 0, fmt + typos clean; row 143 pipe-5; only row 143 changed; Cargo untouched;

      via `catch_unwind` so a panicking listener never fails the commit; scan site propagates — matching Java's
      catch-on-commit / no-catch-on-scan); IncrementalScanEvent @ `scan/incremental.rs` plan_files from BOTH append (present→
      inclusive=false, absent→oldest-ancestor+inclusive=true) AND the changelog scan (shared helper). Emit-fire tests prove
      events GENUINELY fire on real scans/commits (empty scan fires none; property-only commit fires none). **AC·OO 3 cycles —
      cycle 2 INTRODUCED a contract bug** (injected `operation` into CreateSnapshotEvent.summary; Java's in-memory
      `snapshot.summary()` EXCLUDES operation — it's a SEPARATE field/accessor; `SnapshotSummary.Builder` builds only
      total-*/added-*/changed-partition-count); cycle-3 Critic caught it + reverted (summary = `additional_properties`,
      operation-free; test asserts `!contains_key("operation")`). **Orchestrator-verified:** re-ran gate MYSELF (lib **2584**/0,
      clippy 0, fmt+typos clean); confirmed the summary contract vs bytecode; Cargo untouched (std LazyLock, NO dep); only row
      142 changed (pipe-5); census **35✅/27🟡/6❌ → 36✅/27🟡/5❌**. **The Critic-git-checkout-clobber did NOT recur** — the
      hardening worked (Critic instructed to revert mutations via surgical inverse Edits, never git checkout). 3 LOW residue
      (named, accepted): table_name = `namespace.name` (TableIdent) vs Java catalog-qualified `table.name()`; best-effort swallow
      is SILENT (the iceberg crate does NOT declare `tracing` — it's a workspace dep only; metrics/mod.rs defers it identically;
      a `tracing::warn` would need a Cargo edit + approval); a multi_thread event test would need explicit registry-arming.

  _Delivered spec (reference):_ `maintenance/rewrite_table_path.rs`: `Table::rewrite_table_path().rewrite_location_prefix(src,
      tgt).staging_location(dir).execute(io)` → `Result{staging_location, copy_plan, latest_version}`, a STAGE-AND-PLAN
      action (rewrites the metadata graph into staging + emits a `(source,target)` copy-plan; does NOT copy data).
      Ports `RewriteTablePathUtil`:
      - **metadata** (`replace_paths`): `location` (Java uses regex `replaceFirst` — the ONE asymmetry vs `newPath`),
        snapshots' `manifest_list`, metadata-log, the 4 `write.*.path` props, `statistics` (Puffin). **Mirror the
        divergences: `partition_statistics` PASSED THROUGH un-rewritten in 1.10.0**; refs/schemas/specs/sort-orders verbatim.
      - **manifest-list/manifests**: rewrite each `manifest_path`, each entry `file_path` + `referenced_data_file`;
        re-emit via `add_existing_file` (preserve seq/snapshot ids — SEMANTIC round-trip, not byte-identical; thread
        format_version). Precondition: path not under `sourcePrefix` → typed error (no panic).
      - **pos-deletes** are the ONLY content-rewritten payload (rewrite col-0 file_path + `replacePathBounds`);
        **eq-deletes verbatim**. **copy-plan DIRECTION differs by class**: staged→target (manifests/lists/pos-deletes)
        vs source→target (data/eq-deletes).
      - **ActionsProvider**: override `rewrite_table_path`→real action, move UNSUPPORTED→SUPPORTED (9/3→10/2), update
        arrays + doc table + partition-12 test IN LOCKSTEP.
      - **Interop (real bidirectional, NOT no-Spark):** `RewriteTablePathOracle` drives core `RewriteTablePathUtil`;
        compare the rewritten path GRAPH + the copy-plan `(source,target)` set+count, both directions; anti-circular
        prefixes; fail-closed sabotage (un-rewritten path / dropped plan entry / wrong copy direction → red). Offline
        unit tests (prefix boundary, idempotence, no-double-rewrite, the 4 props, partition-stats pass-through,
        pos-delete content+bounds, referenced_data_file, copy-plan direction, precondition errors) + mutation baits.
      - **DEFER (named residue):** incremental `startVersion`/`endVersion` + version-diff + version-hint write
        (additive via the core overloads, not a redesign).
      - **HONEST FLIP: 137 ❌→🟡 not ✅** — 137 bundles `SnapshotTable`/`MigrateTable` which ingest an EXTERNAL
        Hive/filesystem source the Rust core has no path for → they stay ❌ (1 of 3 delivered). Census 34✅/25🟡/9❌ →

Follow-on residue (surfaced mid-charter 2026-06-16, see GAP_MATRIX row 94):

- [ ] **Multi-spec MERGING-path: route `MergeManifestProcess` into the non-append actions (WIRING gap —
      RE-CHARACTERIZED 2026-06-16 post-review, Rust-side code-verified).** The earlier framing ("Rust's
      merging producer doesn't mirror Java's `first`-relative force-merge") was IMPRECISE and would have
      sent a future session chasing a phantom bug. `merge_append.rs::bin_disposition` ALREADY ports Java's
      `mergeGroup` force-merge of non-`first` spec bins faithfully (`bin_len==1` keep; `contains_first &&
      < min_count_to_merge` keep; else MERGE), with a passing multi-spec test. The REAL gap: the non-append
      merging actions (`RowDelta`/`OverwriteFiles`/`RewriteFiles`/`ReplacePartitions`/`DeleteFiles`) all
      commit through `DefaultManifestProcess` (a no-op), so they NEVER merge manifests, while Java's extend
      `MergingSnapshotProducer` (merge-capable past `min-count-to-merge`). Impact = manifest-list LAYOUT
      only (NOT data / seq / partition), DORMANT below threshold. Steps: (a) FIRST confirm via the Java
      reference checkout that `BaseRowDelta`/`BaseOverwriteFiles` actually merge multi-spec manifests at
      default settings (the asymmetry may be narrower than assumed); (b) if so, reuse the existing
      `MergeManifestProcess` in those actions; (c) THEN the multi-spec DATA cases (overwrite/rewrite
      carrying old-spec + adding new-spec) can be interop'd.

See [[parity-next-work]] (memory) for the reusable harness gotchas (register_table `<version>-<uuid>`
name; LocalTableOperations re-seed; final.metadata.json untouched).

## DONE (2026-06-15, Opus): OverwriteFiles conflict-validation interop (C1 — first conflict unit)

Goal: prove the FIRST slice of the rows 91-95 residue ("conflict-validation paths NOT covered").
Show `OverwriteFiles.validate_no_conflicting_data()` + `conflict_detection_filter(Predicate)` matches
Java `BaseOverwriteFiles.validate` → `validateAddedDataFiles` (`validateNoConflictingData`) on the
SAME concurrent-commit scenario — Rust rejects exactly when Java rejects, accepts exactly when Java
accepts, including the filter boundary. INTEROP-ONLY (no production change expected). Scope:
`dev/java-interop/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/InteropOracle.java` (new `OverwriteConflictOracle`),
`dev/java-interop/run-interop-overwrite-conflict.sh` (new), `crates/iceberg/tests/interop_overwrite_conflict.rs`
(new), committed fixtures, + GAP_MATRIX row 91 (annotate the conflict-validation evidence) and the two
map.md rows (dev/java-interop, crates/iceberg/tests). Java 1.10.0 oracle; mvn + JDK11 confirmed live.

- [ ] Read the EXISTING OverwriteFiles conflict unit tests (overwrite_files.rs) + the shared walk in
      snapshot.rs (`added_data_files_after` / `validate_no_conflicting_added_data_files` /
      `first_conflicting_file`) — the template for the Rust side. Re-confirm Java 1.10.0 semantics
      (`BaseOverwriteFiles.validate` → `validateAddedDataFiles`) against the jar before coding.
- [ ] Scenario matrix (≥3): (REJECT) concurrent add MATCHES `conflict_detection_filter`;
      (ACCEPT) concurrent add does NOT match the filter; (ACCEPT) no concurrent add. Each: base S0 →
      build overwrite capturing S0 → concurrent S1 add → commit overwrite → record ACCEPT|REJECT.
- [ ] Java `OverwriteConflictOracle`: `generate` (build history + emit expected-outcome JSON) +
      `verify` (read the Rust-built history, run the same overwrite, assert SAME outcome, emit the
      `verify-…: N failures` sentinel). Mirror `WriteActionsOracle` structure.
- [ ] Rust `interop_overwrite_conflict.rs`: GEN test (build the concurrent history via the catalog +
      attempt the validated overwrite; assert a REJECT is non-retryable `DataInvalid` + `!retryable()`)
      and comparison test (Rust validates the Java-built history → outcome == Java's expected JSON).
      Env-var gated (unset ⇒ clean no-op; offline `cargo test` gate stays green).
- [ ] Shell `run-interop-overwrite-conflict.sh`: reset → Java generate → Rust GEN → Java verify (D2)
      → Rust compare (D1) → 2nd pass → SABOTAGE (flip a REJECT scenario's filter so the conflict
      vanishes ⇒ verify must FAIL closed; HARD-FAIL, never SKIP, if the mutation cannot apply).
- [ ] Run the LIVE oracle end-to-end (mvn) + commit the generated fixtures. Gate in ONE `&&` chain to
      the commit: `typos . && cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --all-targets -p iceberg --
      -D warnings && cargo test -p iceberg --test interop_overwrite_conflict`.
- [ ] Annotate GAP_MATRIX row 91 with the conflict-validation interop evidence (cell edit + link
      ONLY); update the two map.md rows. Done-bar: ✅ for the OverwriteFiles conflict-validation
      SLICE (unit + interop); row 91 stays 🟡 until its multi-spec + row-filter residue also closes;
      rows 92-95 conflict-validation are follow-on units (queue item 1).

> **Done (2026-06-15):** all steps landed. New files: `crates/iceberg/tests/interop_overwrite_conflict.rs`
> (GEN + D1) and `dev/java-interop/run-interop-overwrite-conflict.sh`; new `OverwriteConflictOracle`

> / ReplacePartitions / RewriteFiles conflict interop.

## LANDED (2026-06-13) — status in GAP_MATRIX rows 95/140; clears next archival pass: RewriteFiles DELETE-file ADD surface

Goal: port the unported DELETE-file ADD surface on `RewriteFiles` — `addFile(DeleteFile)` /
`addFile(DeleteFile, long)` (explicit-seq overload) + the 4-set
`rewriteFiles(data_to_replace, delete_to_replace, data_to_add, delete_to_add)` — and lift the third
precondition (`addsDeleteFiles() ⇒ deletesDeleteFiles()`) into reachability. Java spec from 1.10.0
bytecode (`BaseRewriteFiles`, `MergingSnapshotProducer.add(DeleteFile)/(DeleteFile,long)`,
`Delegates.PendingDeleteFile`, `SnapshotProducer.writeDeleteFileGroup`). Files: `rewrite_files.rs`,
`snapshot.rs` ONLY. Done-bar 🟡 (unit-tested, interop deferred).

- [ ] **snapshot.rs** — model the `PendingDeleteFile` per-file optional explicit data-seq: store added
      delete files as `Vec<(DataFile, Option<i64>)>` (None = inherit). Keep
      `with_added_delete_files(Vec<DataFile>)` mapping each to `(file, None)` (RowDelta unchanged); add
      `with_added_delete_files_with_seq(...)`. Stamp the explicit seq in `write_added_delete_manifests`
      (mirror `writeDeleteFileGroup`: `add(file, seq)` if Some, else `add(file)` = inherit). Update the
      validation/empty-check/summary read sites to destructure the pair.
- [ ] **rewrite_files.rs** — `add_delete_file(DeleteFile)` / `add_delete_files(...)` (inherited seq),
      `add_delete_file_with_sequence_number(DeleteFile, i64)` (Java `addFile(DeleteFile, long)`),
      `rewrite_files_with_deletes(4 sets)` (Java 4-arg). Make precondition (3) reachable
      (`adds_delete_files = !added_delete_files.is_empty()`). Content-guard + negative-seq guard on
      added delete files. Route added deletes through `with_added_delete_files_with_seq`.
- [ ] **Tests** (rewrite_files.rs): crown-jewel rewrite a delete file into a NEW delete file + post-commit
      MoR scan (no resurrection); explicit-seq overload stamps the given seq (on-disk pre-inheritance via
      the manifest reader); 4-arg atomic (data AND delete sets in ONE Replace snapshot); precondition (3)
      both-directions; content + negative-seq guards. Mutation: seq-strip → resurrection test fails.
- [ ] **Gate**: `typos . && cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -D warnings && cargo test -p iceberg --lib`
      (twice). Update `transaction/map.md` rewrite_files row + the third-precondition note.

## LANDED (2026-06-13) — status in GAP_MATRIX row 134; clears next archival pass: `caseSensitive(bool)` on the expression-binding write actions

Add `case_sensitive(bool)` (DEFAULT TRUE = Java default, 1.10.0 bytecode-confirmed:
`MergingSnapshotProducer` ctor `iconst_1; putfield caseSensitive`; `ManifestFilterManager` ctor same)
to `DeleteFiles` / `OverwriteFiles` / `RowDelta` and thread through the shared snapshot.rs binding
sites. Scope: `delete_files.rs`, `overwrite_files.rs`, `row_delta.rs`, `replace_partitions.rs`,
`snapshot.rs` ONLY. Java refs: `api/{DeleteFiles,OverwriteFiles,RowDelta}.caseSensitive(boolean)`
present; `api/ReplacePartitions` has NO `caseSensitive` (javap-confirmed) — narrow it out.

- [x] snapshot.rs: threaded `case_sensitive` into `resolve_filter_deletes` (+`build_residual_evaluator`
      →`ResidualEvaluator::of`) and `validate_no_new_deletes_for_data_files`. The `eval(..., true)`
      (include_empty_files) calls left untouched. Forced 1-token out-of-scope edit: `rewrite_files.rs`
      passes `true` (inert — its conflict filter is `None`; documented).
- [x] delete_files.rs: `case_sensitive: bool` field (default true) + `case_sensitive(bool)` builder;
      threaded via `DeleteFilesOperation`. Deferred doc comment rewritten.
- [x] overwrite_files.rs: field + builder; threaded into `resolve_filter_deletes`, the 4 conflict
      helpers, and the StrictMetricsEvaluator row-filter bind in
      `check_added_files_match_overwrite_filter`. Java-faithful: partition-projection binds stay `true`
      (Java uses the single-arg `Projections`/two-arg `Evaluator`; only the StrictMetricsEvaluator takes
      `isCaseSensitive()` — bytecode-verified).
- [x] row_delta.rs: field + builder; threaded into the conflict helpers, `validate_added_dvs`, and
      `validate_no_new_deletes_for_data_files`. `validate_fresh_dvs_only` left (by-path/partition).
- [x] replace_partitions.rs: NARROWED — `javap -p` confirms no `caseSensitive` in the Java public API +
      validate path is partition-set-based (no `Predicate::bind`). Documented, no builder added.
- [x] Tests: 9 total (3/action). Mutation-verified BOTH directions at BOTH shared sites, failing all 3
      actions' tests simultaneously (ignore-flag ⇒ false-direction tests fail; hard-code-false ⇒
      boundary tests fail).

> **Done (2026-06-13):** `case_sensitive(bool)` landed on DeleteFiles/OverwriteFiles/RowDelta (DEFAULT
> TRUE), narrowed out of ReplacePartitions per Java 1.10.0 API. Gate green (typos/fmt/clippy + 2× lib
> @ 2258). Interop deferred → row 134 stays 🟡. GAP_MATRIX rows 134/135 updated.

## LANDED (2026-06-13) — status in GAP_MATRIX row 135; clears next archival pass: `DeleteFiles.deleteFromRowFilter(Expression)` delete-by-predicate

Close the deferral in `delete_files.rs` L30-32. Java bytecode-confirmed (`javap -p -c` on
iceberg-api/core 1.10.0): `StreamingDelete.deleteFromRowFilter(Expression)` → `MergingSnapshotProducer.deleteByRowFilter`
→ the SAME `ManifestFilterManager.manifestHasDeletedFiles` path `OverwriteFiles.overwriteByRowFilter`
already ports via `SnapshotProducer::resolve_filter_deletes`. `StreamingDelete.operation()` is the
CONSTANT `"delete"` (NOT dynamic). PARTIAL ⇒ "Cannot delete file where some, but not all, rows match
filter %s: %s" (verbatim string in the 1.10.0 jar). Scope: `crates/iceberg/src/transaction/delete_files.rs` ONLY.

- [x] Add `delete_from_row_filter(Predicate)` builder method (stores `Option<Predicate>` row filter).
- [x] Thread the row filter into `DeleteFilesOperation`; its `delete_files` unions `resolve_delete_paths`
      with `resolve_filter_deletes(row_filter)` (de-dupe by path) — mirroring `OverwriteFilesOperation`.
      `operation()` stays `Operation::Delete` (StreamingDelete constant).
- [x] Tests: A strictly-covered (deleted), B provably-cannot-match (kept), C partial (ERROR, nothing
      committed); residual KEEP/DELETE/PARTIAL pins; negative residual-non-match; combine-with-by-path.
- [x] Update `delete_files.rs` module doc (remove the deferral note) + the map.md row 39.
- Done-bar: 🟡 (unit-tested; interop deferred — flagged for the critic). `caseSensitive(bool)` is a
  SEPARATE GAP_MATRIX row — explicitly OUT of this increment (filter bound case-sensitive `true`, the
  Java default, as the precedent does).
- Outcome (2026-06-13): landed in `delete_files.rs` (`delete_from_row_filter` builder + `row_filter`
  field threaded into `DeleteFilesOperation`, unioned with by-path via the SHARED
  `resolve_filter_deletes` — no fork). 8 new tests; full gate green (typos/fmt/clippy + lib ×2 =
  2246 passed). Two mutations verified-then-reverted (residual→full-predicate caught by 3 tests incl.
  the dedicated partition-residual pin; strict→inclusive over-broaden caught by the crown-jewel partial
  test). DEFERRED for the reviewer/orchestrator: flip the GAP_MATRIX `deleteFromRowFilter` row ❌→🟡
  (outside the explicit modify-list), and data-level Java↔Rust interop.

## 2026-07-10 — Zero-width / oversized bucket-truncate transforms: reject at parse, never panic at apply (BUG-001/SAF-001/BUG-013)

Plan (delegated BUILDER; done-bar 🟡 unit-tested, interop deferred):

- [x] Java contract (bytecode-verified, 1.10.0 jar): `Bucket.get(int)` bytecode `<= 0` reject-branch + msg
  `"Invalid number of buckets: %s (must be > 0)"` (Bucket.java:41-42); `Truncate.get(int)` bytecode
  `<= 0` reject-branch + msg `"Invalid truncate width: %s (must be > 0)"` (Truncate.java:42);
  `Transforms.fromString` parses via `Integer.parseInt` (Transforms.java:39,45) so values >
  `Integer.MAX_VALUE` are unrepresentable ⇒ parity bound is `1..=i32::MAX` for both.
- [x] `spec/transform.rs`: add `Transform::validate()` (Java-precondition messages); call it from
  `FromStr` bucket/truncate arms (covers serde/Deserialize ⇒ table-metadata JSON, partition specs,
  sort orders). Tests: reject 0 + `i32::MAX as u64 + 1` on both; boundary-legal 1 and `i32::MAX`
  accepted (over-broaden pin); JSON serde rejection.
- [x] `transform/bucket.rs`: `Bucket::new(u32) -> Result<Self>`, store `mod_n: i32` via zero-check +
  `i32::try_from` (drops the lossy `as i32` in `bucket_n` — wrong-bucket wrap for N > i32::MAX).
- [x] `transform/truncate.rs`: `Truncate::new(u32) -> Result<Self>` with the same 1..=i32::MAX guard
  (division/modulo-by-zero in `truncate_i32/i64/decimal_i128` becomes unreachable).
- [x] `transform/mod.rs`: `create_transform_function` propagates the fallible constructors (`?`) —
  the apply-door defense; direct `Transform::Bucket(0)` (public enum payload, not blockable) now
  errors instead of panicking.
- [x] `spec/partition.rs`: `transform.validate()` in both builders (`add_partition_field_internal`
  unbound + `add_unbound_field` bound) — the programmatic route Java rejects at construction.
  Crown-jewel test: minimal V2 TableMetadata JSON, control (bucket[16]) parses, sabotage
  (bucket[0] / truncate[0]) fails with `ErrorKind::DataInvalid` via the production
  `serde_json → Error::from` conversion (`read_from` path).
- [x] Gate: typos + fmt + clippy + `cargo test -p iceberg --lib` ×2; mutation-check the guards both
  directions (disable ⇒ rejection tests red; over-broaden ⇒ boundary-legal tests red).
- Outcome (2026-07-10): landed. Parse door = `Transform::validate()` called from `FromStr`
  (covers Deserialize -> table metadata / partition specs / sort orders); apply door =
  fallible `Bucket::new` / `Truncate::new` (independent guards) propagated by
  `create_transform_function`; builder door = `validate()` in both partition-spec builders.
  `bucket_n` now stores a construction-proven `i32` (lossy `as i32` removed). 16 new tests incl.
  the crown-jewel TableMetadata fixture (control-first; Java-text pinned at the PartitionSpec
  serde door - the untagged TableMetadataEnum swallows inner messages). Mutations M1 (parse bound
  off: 6 tests RED, apply door stayed green - layer independence), M2 (apply guards off +
  unchecked cast restored: 8 tests RED incl. the project-panic pin), M3 (over-broadened bounds:
  3 boundary-legal tests RED) - all restored, full gate green (typos/fmt/clippy + lib 2740 x2).
  Done-bar partial: interop (Java-side cross-validation of the rejection) deferred; GAP_MATRIX
  untouched (hardening, no capability row).
